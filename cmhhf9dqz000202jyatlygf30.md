</p><p>Historically, industries have relied on high-temperature SCR catalysts, but the increasing demand for operational efficiency and cost reduction has led to a shift toward low-temperature alternatives. In particular, the non-electric industrial sectors, including metallurgy and manufacturing, are experiencing heightened adoption due to their complex flue gas characteristics and the difficulty of maintaining higher operating temperatures.</p><p>
</p><p>Low Temperature Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) Catalysts are advanced emission control technologies that facilitate the reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) into harmless nitrogen (N2) and water (H2O) at relatively lower operational temperatures, typically ranging from room temperature to below 300°C. Unlike traditional high-temperature SCR systems, low temperature SCR catalysts are designed to function efficiently in environments where heating flue gases is either energy-intensive or technically impractical. These catalysts are composed of a blend of metal oxides, zeolites, and other active materials that promote the oxidation-reduction reactions necessary for NOx conversion.</p><p>
</p><p>They are widely applied in various non-electric industrial settings such as steel, cement, glass, and coke production plants. These environments often produce flue gases with unique properties such as low temperatures, high dust content, and fluctuating chemical compositions. The low-temperature SCR technology eliminates the need for costly flue gas reheating, making it a cost-effective, energy-saving, and environmentally friendly option for industrial NOx reduction.</p><p>
