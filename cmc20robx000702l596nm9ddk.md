</p><p><strong>Market Size</strong></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Liquid Silicone Rubber (LSR)</strong> is a high-purity, two-component silicone compound that exhibits unique characteristics such as high thermal stability, flexibility, chemical resistance, and biocompatibility. This material is processed through liquid injection molding, making it suitable for a wide array of applications across multiple industries including automotive, healthcare, electronics, and consumer goods. LSR is preferred for its efficiency in high-volume manufacturing and its ability to create complex, detailed parts with precision.</p><p>
</p><p>The key differentiator for LSR from other silicone rubbers lies in its low viscosity, which allows it to flow easily into molds, and its rapid curing capability at elevated temperatures. These properties make it ideal for producing high-precision components that require durability and strength under harsh conditions. LSR is widely used for seals, gaskets, medical implants, baby care products, and insulation components in electrical systems.</p><p>
