# United States Acoustic Plasterboard Market Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Acoustic plasterboard is a type of gypsum board that is specially engineered to absorb sound. It is used in both residential and commercial construction to reduce noise transmission between rooms or between floors. These plasterboards are designed to achieve high sound reduction ratings, which make them ideal for environments where noise control is essential, such as offices, hotels, schools, and hospitals.</p><p>
</p><p>The boards come in various thicknesses, typically 10mm and 13mm, and are composed of gypsum with sound-absorbing properties. They are a critical component of acoustic design, especially in the construction of buildings aiming for green certifications and improved environmental sustainability.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

<strong>Market Size</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The United States Acoustic Plasterboard market was valued at <strong>US$ 324.5 million in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>US$ 456.8 million by 2030</strong>, growing at a <strong>Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 5.9%</strong> during the forecast period (2024-2030).</p><p>
</p><p>The market's growth is supported by the increasing demand for better soundproofing solutions in commercial and residential buildings. With the rising adoption of smart building systems and green building certifications, the demand for acoustic plasterboard is expected to continue growing.</p><p>
<strong>Market Dynamics</strong></p><p>
<strong>Drivers</strong></p><p>

	</p><p><strong>Increased Demand for Commercial Construction</strong>: Commercial buildings represent approximately 60% of the applications for acoustic plasterboard. As urbanization continues and more commercial spaces are built, the demand for noise-reduction solutions is expected to grow. These plasterboards are particularly important in office buildings, hospitals, hotels, and educational institutions, where quiet environments are critical.</p><p><strong>Environmental Sustainability</strong>: Acoustic plasterboards are increasingly made from recycled materials, with up to 35% of the material composition being recycled content. This supports the green building movement, as many new constructions aim for sustainability certifications like LEED.</p><p><strong>Technological Integration</strong>: The integration of acoustic plasterboards with smart building systems is becoming more common, enhancing building automation and reducing costs by about 20%. As buildings become more intelligent, the demand for such materials increases, boosting market growth.</p><p>
<strong>Restraints</strong></p><p>

	</p><p><strong>High Initial Cost</strong>: The cost of acoustic plasterboard is higher compared to regular gypsum boards due to its specialized composition and sound-dampening features. This can limit its widespread adoption in budget-conscious residential construction projects.</p><p><strong>Installation Complexity</strong>: Although installation efficiency has improved by 30% due to manufacturing automation, the process of installing acoustic plasterboard is still more complex than standard plasterboards, which could deter some contractors from using it.</p><p>
<strong>Opportunities</strong></p><p>

	</p><p><strong>Growth in Residential Market</strong>: As the residential market grows, particularly in urban areas, there is a significant opportunity for acoustic plasterboard manufacturers to tap into this demand. Homeowners and builders are becoming more conscious of noise control and comfort in residential settings.</p><p><strong>Increasing Green Building Certification Demand</strong>: With 25% of the demand being driven by green building certifications, the focus on eco-friendly construction methods is likely to expand further. As energy-efficient and noise-reducing materials become more desirable, acoustic plasterboards will continue to be a key component of sustainable architecture.</p><p>
<strong>Challenges</strong></p><p>

	</p><p><strong>Competition from Alternative Soundproofing Solutions</strong>: Alternatives like foam panels and sound-damping curtains could pose competition to acoustic plasterboard in some markets. These alternatives are often easier to install, which could affect market share.</p><p><strong>Fluctuating Raw Material Prices</strong>: Acoustic plasterboard manufacturers rely on raw materials such as gypsum and recycled content. Price fluctuations of these materials could impact production costs and, in turn, the pricing structure of acoustic plasterboards.</p><p>
