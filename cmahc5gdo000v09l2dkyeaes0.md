# Latin America O-Cresol Market Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>O-Cresol, or ortho-cresol, is a phenolic compound widely utilized in chemical synthesis and industrial applications. It is primarily derived from coal tar and petroleum refining processes. As an essential chemical intermediate, O-Cresol plays a crucial role in producing resins, disinfectants, herbicides, and other specialty chemicals. Its controlled production requires strict safety measures due to its toxicity and flammability.</p><p>
