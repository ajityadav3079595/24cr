# Trimethylaluminum (TMA) Market, Global Outlook & Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Trimethylaluminum (TMA) is a highly reactive organoaluminum compound with the chemical formula Al2(CH3)6. It exists as a dimer and is widely used in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) processes, primarily in the semiconductor, LED, and solar cell industries. Due to its pyrophoric nature, TMA requires careful handling in controlled environments.</p><p>
