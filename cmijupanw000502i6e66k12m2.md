These technological improvements enable manufacturers to create value-added formulations with precise dosing and enhanced bioavailability.</p><p>
<strong>MARKET CHALLENGES</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Regulatory Fragmentation Complicates Market Expansion</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The global regulatory landscape for St. John's Wort remains highly fragmented, creating barriers to international market growth. Classification varies significantly by region - while some countries approve it as an OTC medicine, others regulate it as a dietary supplement or traditional herbal product. Recent changes in key markets, including stricter labeling requirements in the EU and product registration mandates in several Asian countries, have increased compliance costs by <strong>an estimated 15-20%</strong> for manufacturers.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Additional Challenges</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Consumer Education Deficits</strong></p><p>
Despite growing awareness, misconceptions persist about appropriate St. John's Wort usage. Approximately <strong>40% of consumers</strong> remain unaware of potential drug interactions, and only 30% understand the importance of standardized extracts.
