</p><p><strong>Electrofuels, also known as e-fuels or synthetic fuels, represent a transformative class of carbon-neutral, drop-in replacement fuels. These fuels are produced using renewable electricity to synthesize hydrocarbons or other fuel molecules, typically by combining hydrogen (produced via electrolysis) with captured carbon dioxide. The resultant liquid or gaseous fuels—such as e-diesel, e-methanol, and e-kerosene—can directly replace conventional fossil fuels without requiring significant modifications to existing engines or infrastructure.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>This compatibility makes electrofuels particularly attractive for sectors where electrification is challenging, including aviation, shipping, and heavy-duty transport. As global regulations tighten around carbon emissions and decarbonization goals become more urgent, the development and deployment of electrofuels are gaining significant traction worldwide.</strong></p><p>
