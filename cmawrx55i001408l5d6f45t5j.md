# PVC Films and Sheets Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) films and sheets are versatile plastic materials derived from PVC resin. Known for their durability, chemical resistance, and flexibility, they are extensively used across various industries. PVC films are thin and flexible, making them ideal for applications such as packaging, medical devices, and protective coverings. PVC sheets, being thicker and more rigid, find use in construction, automotive interiors, and industrial applications. The demand for PVC films and sheets is driven by their cost-effectiveness, ease of processing, and ability to be customized to specific requirements.</p><p>
