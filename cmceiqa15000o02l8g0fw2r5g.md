</p><p><strong>Milnacipran</strong> is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) primarily prescribed for fibromyalgia and major depressive disorder (MDD). Unlike selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), it targets both serotonin and norepinephrine levels, making it effective in managing chronic pain and depressive symptoms. The drug is available in powder, crystal, and granule forms, often formulated into tablets and capsules for oral administration.</p><p>
</p><p>Clinical trials confirm its efficacy in improving mood and reducing pain sensitivity, though side effects such as nausea and dizziness may impact patient adherence. Its dual-action mechanism positions Milnacipran as a key component of the global pharmaceutical market.</p><p>
