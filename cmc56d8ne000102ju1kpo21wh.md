</p><p>Silicone protective film is a thin film made of silicone material, also known as silane protective film. Silicones are a class of compounds that contain silicon atoms and organic groups in their molecular structure. Silicone protective film has a series of excellent performance and application characteristics. The main features of silicone protective film are as follows: 1. Heat resistance: Silicone protective film has high heat resistance, can withstand the use in high temperature environment, and is not easy to deform or melt. This makes it good protection in high temperature processes or high temperature environments. 2. Chemical resistance: Silicone protective film has good resistance to many chemical substances, and is not easy to be eroded and corroded by acids, alkalis, solvents, etc. This makes it effective in protecting substrates or surfaces from chemical damage.3. Wear resistance: Silicone protective film has high wear resistance and can effectively resist external forces such as scratches, wear and friction. It protects the covering or surface from mechanical damage. 4. Transparency: Silicone protective film has good transparency and will not affect the appearance and visual effect of the protected object. It can maintain the clarity and brightness of the protected object. 5. Weather resistance: Silicone protective film has good weather resistance, can resist the influence of ultraviolet rays, high temperature, humidity and other harsh environments, and maintain long-term stable performance and appearance. Silicone protective films are widely used in various fields that need protection, such as electronic products, automobiles, building materials, household items, etc. It can provide effective protection and enhance the durability of materials, prolong the service life, and improve the quality and value of products.</p><p>
