</p><p><strong>Asia-Pacific is expected to witness the fastest growth due to rapid urbanization, ongoing industrial developments, and government-led initiatives in countries such as China and India to enhance civil infrastructure durability.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) rebar, also referred to as fiberglass rebar, is a high-performance composite material used to reinforce concrete structures. Composed of high-strength glass fibers embedded in a polymer matrix (typically epoxy, vinyl ester, or polyester resins), GFRP rebars offer numerous advantages over traditional steel rebar. These include superior corrosion resistance, lightweight properties, high tensile strength, and excellent fatigue performance. As such, GFRP rebar is increasingly favored in infrastructure projects, especially in corrosive environments such as coastal structures, bridges, marine construction, and wastewater treatment plants.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>The development of GFRP rebar addresses key limitations of steel reinforcement, notably susceptibility to corrosion and heavy weight. With civil engineering increasingly emphasizing sustainability and lifecycle performance, the demand for GFRP as a viable alternative to steel is on the rise. Its non-magnetic and non-conductive properties further expand its use in MRI facilities and high-voltage environments.</strong></p><p>
