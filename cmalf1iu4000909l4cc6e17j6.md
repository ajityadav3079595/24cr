# Caprolactone Market, Global Outlook & Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Caprolactone is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a seven-membered ring derived from caproic acid. It is a colorless liquid that is highly miscible with most organic solvents and water. Caprolactone is widely used as a precursor in the production of caprolactam and polycaprolactone polymers. Its chemical properties make it an essential raw material in the manufacturing of various high-performance resins, coatings, adhesives, and biomedical applications.</p><p>
