</p><p>Glyoxylic Acid Monohydrate (CAS 563-96-2) is a white crystalline powder with the molecular formula C2H4O4. It is an organic compound that serves as a versatile intermediate in organic synthesis. Glyoxylic acid monohydrate is primarily used in the pharmaceutical industry but also finds applications in agrochemicals, cosmetics, and polymer production. As a reactive aldehyde-acid compound, it is particularly important in the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), such as antibiotics, antihypertensive drugs, and skin-lightening agents like allantoin. Due to its ability to participate in condensation reactions, it is also valuable in the production of fragrance chemicals and specialty fine chemicals. This dual functional group compound—containing both aldehyde and carboxylic acid—makes it a critical reagent in complex chemical formulations.</p><p>
