# Self-Cleaning Glasses Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Self-cleaning glass is a revolutionary product that utilizes advanced surface coatings to prevent dirt and grime from adhering to its surface, thereby reducing the need for frequent cleaning. The self-cleaning process is typically achieved through a special coating that is activated by sunlight and rain. This coating utilizes two main processes: hydrophilic action and photocatalytic action.</p><p>
