From a narrow sens, the molecular sieve is a crystalline silicate or silicoaluminate, formed by a silicon-oxygen tetrahedron or an aluminum-oxygen tetrahedron connected by an oxygen-bridge bond. From the broad sense, there are regular and uniform pores in the structure, the aperture of which is an order of magnitude of the size of the molecule. It only allows molecules with a diameter smaller than the aperture to enter, so the molecules in the mixture can be screened by size.Molecular sieve industry technology is relatively mature, low - end product entry threshold is relatively low.The key technologies are controlled by UOP, a subsidiary of honeywell in the us, CECA, a subsidiary of Arkema in France, Tosoh in Japan and Grace in the us.Meanwhile, the high-end product field is almost occupied by these leading multinational companies.China has a large number of enterprises, but the overall relatively scattered scale is not high.Domestic large scale such as Dalian Haixin Chemical co., LTD., Luoyang Jianlong Chemical co., LTD., Shanghai Hengye Chemical co., LTD., etc., in more than 50 domestic production enterprises in a relatively leading position.In terms of market demand, it has maintained a steady growth in recent years. With the recovery of the global economy, especially the economic growth in the United States, and the rapid economic growth in China, India and other countries, the molecular sieve industry will maintain the current growth momentum in the future.After years of development, with the improvement of network information transparency, the market of molecular sieve industry in China has realized full competition, and has formed industrial clusters according to traffic, resources and other factors, to achieve high cost saving.On the whole, China's molecular sieve industry is a small industry with a total capacity of about 140,000 tons, an annual output of about 100,000 tons and an annual output value of about 200 million U.S. dollars.Domestic enterprises are relatively dispersed, the products are mainly medium and low-end products, but the domestic demand is large, UOP has established a production base in China as early as possible, and expanded the production capacity in the Shanghai base in 2006.Other multinationals may also set up production bases or joint ventures in China in the future.In recent years, with the domestic environmental protection is becoming more and more strict supervision and inspection measures, a large number of small plant elimination closure, lead to decreasing of production enterprises, facing a shortage of supply, leading to domestic product price is on the rise, remaining enterprises gross margin improved, showing a strong stronger, in the coming years, product prices and gross margin is expected to continue to maintain strong, domestic will emerge a batch of mature and stable product quality excellent enterprise, its place in the international market.</p><p>
