# Food Grade Sodium Propionate Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Food-grade sodium propionate is a sodium salt of propionic acid widely used as a preservative in the food industry. It acts as an antimicrobial agent, preventing the growth of mold and bacteria in baked goods, dairy products, and processed meats. Due to its effectiveness in enhancing shelf life without compromising food quality, sodium propionate is a critical ingredient in food preservation. It is also recognized as a Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) substance by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).</p><p>
