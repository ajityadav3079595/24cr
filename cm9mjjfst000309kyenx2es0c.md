# Semiconductor Non-UV Tape Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p><strong>The global Semiconductor Non-UV Tape market was valued at USD 359 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 572.71 million by 2030, exhibiting a CAGR of 6.90% during the forecast period.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Semiconductor Non-UV Tape</strong>, also known as temporary bonding tape, is a specialized adhesive tape used in semiconductor manufacturing processes. Unlike UV-release tapes that require ultraviolet light exposure for debonding, non-UV tape relies on alternative mechanisms such as pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSA) or thermal bonding. These tapes are primarily used for <strong>temporary wafer bonding, handling, and protection</strong>, ensuring delicate wafers remain intact during dicing, grinding, and other critical processes in semiconductor fabrication.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
