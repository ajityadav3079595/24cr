# Povidone (PVP) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Povidone (PVP), also known as polyvinylpyrrolidone, is a water-soluble polymer widely used in pharmaceutical, cosmetic, food, and industrial applications. It appears as a white or yellowish powder or an aqueous solution and is highly valued for its hygroscopicity, film-forming capability, complexation, and physiological compatibility. Due to its excellent solubility in water and various organic solvents, PVP is extensively used as a binder, stabilizer, and suspending agent in diverse industries.</p><p>
