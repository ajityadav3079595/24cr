</p><p><strong>The rise of eco-conscious printing and consumer preferences for aesthetically appealing packaging are key contributors to market expansion globally. The market is also benefiting from increased investments in food and beverage packaging, where dry offset is a preferred solution due to its flexibility, precision, and reduced environmental footprint.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Dry offset printing, also known as Letterset or Indirect Relief Printing, is a hybrid printing process that merges the benefits of both letterpress and offset printing technologies. In this process, the image is transferred from a raised surface (similar to letterpress) to a rubber blanket, and then to the substrate, typically without using water as in traditional offset lithography. This method is particularly advantageous for printing on non-porous surfaces such as plastics, making it the go-to choice for applications like printing on plastic pails, buckets, tubes, and various cylindrical or conical containers.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Unlike wet offset printing, dry offset printing employs special ink systems and printing plates that do not require dampening. This dry mechanism ensures precise color registration and faster drying times, which are vital for high-speed production environments. Its ability to deliver high-quality multi-color images on irregular surfaces continues to fuel its adoption across the packaging, container labeling, and industrial branding industries.</strong></p><p>
