</p><p>North America, one of the major regional markets, contributed<strong> USD 58.94 million to the global revenue in 2023 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.29% through 2032</strong>. The Asia-Pacific region is emerging as a significant driver of growth, with rising industrialization, increased manufacturing output, and investments in chemical and material innovations further accelerating market expansion.</p><p>
</p><p>In addition to growing end-user demand, market size is being influenced by supply-side developments including new manufacturing facilities, strategic alliances, and advancements in purification and synthesis technologies. Overall, the growing reliance on high-purity monomers in specialized applications is expected to further drive the GMA market over the next decade.</p><p>
</p><p>Glycidyl Methacrylate (GMA) is a colorless, transparent liquid organic compound that is an ester of methacrylic acid and glycidol. With the chemical formula C7H10O3, it is characterized by the presence of both an epoxy group and a methacrylate group. This dual functionality makes GMA an invaluable intermediate in the production of polymers and resins.</p><p>
</p><p>GMA is primarily used as a reactive monomer in the synthesis of specialty polymers. It introduces epoxy functionality into acrylate or polyolefin chains, thereby enhancing adhesion, durability, and mechanical properties. These properties make GMA suitable for a wide range of applications, such as:</p><p>
</p><p>Coatings and paints</p><p>Adhesives and sealants</p><p>Printing inks</p><p>Fiber treatment agents</p><p>Thermosetting plastics</p><p>
</p><p>Due to its high reactivity and compatibility with various substrates, GMA is extensively used in industries such as automotive, electronics, packaging, and construction. Its ability to improve the thermal and chemical resistance of materials makes it especially important in advanced composite and surface coating technologies.</p><p>
