<h1>Sintered Permanent Magnetic Material Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Sintered NdFeB (Neodymium Iron Boron) magnets are permanent magnetic materials based on a tetragonal crystal structure composed of neodymium, iron, and boron. These magnets are produced using a powder metallurgy process, where fine powders of the raw materials are mixed, compressed, and then sintered (heated without melting) to form solid magnets. Developed in the early 1980s by M. Sagawa and his team, sintered NdFeB magnets revolutionized the field of permanent magnets due to their high magnetic strength and versatility.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>These magnets are widely used in various applications due to their powerful magnetic properties, including motors, speakers, sensors, and medical equipment. They are crucial components in many modern technologies, particularly those requiring compact, high-performance magnetic materials.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>As of 2023, the global market size for sintered permanent magnetic materials is valued at USD 2,315 million. This market is projected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 8.60%, reaching an estimated USD 4,124.39 million by 2030. The growth is driven by increasing demand for advanced permanent magnets in diverse industries, such as electronics, automotive, energy, and healthcare.</p>
