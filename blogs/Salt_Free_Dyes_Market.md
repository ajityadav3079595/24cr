 <p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Market Size</strong></span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:14px">Salt-free dyes are a class of colorants that are applied without the use of salts, making them highly beneficial in various industries where the removal of residual salts is not desired. These dyes offer vibrant, long-lasting colors and are widely used in textiles, paper, paints, inks, and coatings. The key characteristic of salt-free dyes is that they do not require additional post-dyeing processes to eliminate residual salts, which is typically necessary with conventional dyes. This trait makes salt-free dyes more cost-effective and efficient for manufacturers and more environmentally friendly compared to traditional dyeing methods.</span></p>
