 <p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Semiconductor Non-UV Tape</strong>, also known as temporary bonding tape, is a specialized adhesive tape used in semiconductor manufacturing processes. Unlike UV-release tapes that require ultraviolet light exposure for debonding, non-UV tape relies on alternative mechanisms such as pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSA) or thermal bonding. These tapes are primarily used for <strong>temporary wafer bonding, handling, and protection</strong>, ensuring delicate wafers remain intact during dicing, grinding, and other critical processes in semiconductor fabrication.</span></p>
