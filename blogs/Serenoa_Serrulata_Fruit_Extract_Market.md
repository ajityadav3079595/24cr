 <p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Limited Clinical Evidence</strong></span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:14px">While saw palmetto extract is widely used in herbal supplements, there is still ongoing debate regarding its efficacy in treating prostate issues and hair loss.

Additionally, it may interact with certain medications, such as <strong>blood thinners</strong> or <strong>hormonal therapies</strong>, potentially limiting its use in some individuals.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Expanding Research on Health Benefits</strong></span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:14px">As more research emerges supporting the benefits of saw palmetto extract, especially in the areas of <strong>hormonal balance</strong> and <strong>prostate health</strong>, there is an opportunity for the market to expand.

 <p><span style="font-size:14px">The regulation of herbal products, including saw palmetto extract, varies across regions. In some countries, there is a lack of standardized regulations or quality control for herbal supplements, which could hinder market growth. Ensuring product quality and safety remains a significant challenge for manufacturers in the industry.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Market Fragmentation</strong></span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:14px">The saw palmetto extract market is highly fragmented, with a wide variety of <strong>brands</strong> and <strong>formulations</strong> available. This fragmentation could lead to pricing pressures and increased competition, which may limit profitability for smaller companies.</span></p>

The <strong>U.S.</strong> is the primary consumer of saw palmetto extract, driven by the aging population and a rising preference for <strong>herbal supplements</strong>.
