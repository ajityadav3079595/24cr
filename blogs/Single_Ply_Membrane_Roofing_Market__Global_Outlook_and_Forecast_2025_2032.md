<h1>Single-Ply Membrane Roofing Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:13px">Single-ply roofing membranes are roofing systems composed of a single layer of roofing material. These systems are designed to provide effective weatherproofing and waterproofing for various structures. They are typically used on commercial, industrial, and residential buildings and offer advantages such as flexibility, ease of installation, and UV resistance. The materials commonly used in single-ply membranes include thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM), each offering specific benefits depending on the application.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p>These roofing systems can be applied using adhesives or mechanical fasteners and are widely recognized for their durability, cost-effectiveness, and resistance to harsh environmental conditions. With an increasing focus on energy-efficient solutions and eco-friendly materials, single-ply roofing has become a preferred choice for both new constructions and reroofing projects.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The global single-ply membrane roofing market was valued at approximately USD 2486.50 million in 2023 and is expected to reach USD 3689.68 million by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 5.80% during the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to the increasing demand for energy-efficient roofing systems, advancements in material technology, and a greater focus on sustainable construction practices.</p>
