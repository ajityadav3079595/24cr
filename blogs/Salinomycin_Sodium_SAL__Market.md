 <p><span style="font-size:14px">In agriculture, it is predominantly used as a growth promoter and a coccidiostat in poultry and livestock farming. In medical applications, Salinomycin has been explored as a treatment for certain cancers, owing to its ability to target and inhibit cancer cell growth.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:14px">The SAL market is broadly defined by its application in animal health, feed additives, and emerging medical research for its anti-cancer properties. The market also incorporates various delivery forms, including granules, injectable solutions, and premixes used in animal feed. Over the years, Salinomycin Sodium has garnered attention for its performance in enhancing the health of livestock, reducing veterinary costs, and improving food production efficiency.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:14px">Salinomycin Sodium&#39;s usage as an ionophore antibiotic has evolved with improvements in livestock farming practices, particularly in the context of intensive farming operations. Historically, Salinomycin has found consistent usage in poultry feed as a coccidiostat, preventing infections that affect the digestive tract of chickens, turkeys, and other poultry. Furthermore, the rise in demand for antibiotic-free meat products has propelled the demand for alternatives like SAL that reduce the reliance on traditional antibiotics.</span></p>
