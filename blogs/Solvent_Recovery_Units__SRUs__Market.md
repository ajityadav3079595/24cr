<h1>Solvent Recovery Units (SRUs) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><strong>Solvent Recovery Units (SRUs)</strong>? are specialized systems designed to recover and reuse solvents that would otherwise be disposed of as waste. These systems play a crucial role in waste reduction and environmental sustainability by capturing, purifying, and recycling solvents for further use. Solvent recovery is a cost-effective alternative to replacing solvents entirely, reducing raw material costs and minimizing environmental impact. These units typically consist of components such as condensers, receivers, vacuum pumps, and control systems, all integrated into a customized, efficient package. SRUs are widely used in industries like pharmaceuticals, printing, painting, coatings, and chemicals.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The global? <strong>Solvent Recovery Units (SRUs)</strong>? market size was estimated at? <strong>USD 1,030.40 million in 2023</strong>? and is projected to grow to? <strong>USD 1,191.75 million by 2030</strong>, reflecting a? <strong><strong>CAGR</strong> of 2.10%</strong>? during the forecast period. This steady growth can be attributed to the increasing adoption of waste reduction practices and stringent environmental regulations worldwide.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Regionally,? <strong>North America</strong>? accounted for a significant market share, with a market size of? <strong>USD 268.49 million in 2023</strong>? and an expected? <strong><strong>CAGR</strong> of 1.80%</strong>? from 2025 through 2030.
