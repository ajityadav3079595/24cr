<h1>SBR Granules Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>SBR (Styrene Butadiene Rubber) granules are small particles of synthetic rubber derived from the copolymerization of styrene and butadiene. These granules are renowned for their durability, elasticity, and abrasion resistance, making them a popular choice for a wide range of applications. One of their primary uses is as infill material in artificial turf and sports surfaces, providing cushioning and improved traction. Additionally, SBR granules are utilized in flooring, playgrounds, and shock-absorbing mats due to their excellent impact resistance and cost-effectiveness.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><strong>The global SBR Granules market was valued at USD 521 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 653.94 million by 2030, registering a compound annual growth rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 3.30% during the forecast period. </strong>The market growth is driven by increasing demand for sustainable and durable materials in sports and construction applications.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>In North America, the SBR Granules market size was estimated at USD 135.76 million in 2023, with a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 2.83% anticipated from 2025 through 2030. The region&#39;s growth is attributed to the high adoption of artificial turf in sports fields and landscaping projects.</p>
