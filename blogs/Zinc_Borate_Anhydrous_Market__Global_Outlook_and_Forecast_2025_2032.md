<h1>Zinc Borate Anhydrous Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:14px">Zinc Borate Anhydrous is a compound that plays a significant role in various industrial applications, primarily as a flame retardant and smoke suppressant. Unlike its hydrated counterpart, Zinc Borate Anhydrous does not contain crystal water, resulting in its higher thermal decomposition temperature and lower weight loss at elevated temperatures. This makes it ideal for use in high-temperature polymer systems that are processed above 290??C, including nylon, polyester, polyetherketone, polysulfone, and fluoropolymers.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:14px">Due to its superior thermal stability, zinc borate anhydrous is extensively used in manufacturing applications that require resistance to high heat and flame exposure. It is commonly utilized in polymer systems where fire resistance is critical, offering benefits in both performance and durability. The absence of crystal water also means that it maintains its integrity at temperatures up to 600??C, making it particularly valuable in demanding environments. Additionally, the chemical properties of zinc borate make it effective in suppressing smoke during combustion, which is a key factor in improving safety standards in various industries.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>As of 2023, the global Zinc Borate Anhydrous market was valued at USD 6 million. This market is projected to experience moderate growth with an expected compound annual growth rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 1.20%, reaching an estimated USD 6.52 million by 2030. </strong>The growth of this market is supported by the increasing adoption of zinc borate anhydrous in various high-temperature and fire-resistant applications.</span></p>
