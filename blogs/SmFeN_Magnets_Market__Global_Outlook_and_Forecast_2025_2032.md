 <p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Definition</strong></span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>SmFeN magnets</strong>, short for Samarium-Iron-Nitrogen magnets, are a type of high-performance anisotropic magnet. These magnets are produced through an advanced manufacturing process where SmFeN magnetic powder is mixed with <strong>PA12 (Polyamide 12)</strong> engineering plastic, followed by injection molding in an oriented magnetic field. SmFeN magnets stand out due to their <strong>excellent cost-performance ratio, superior oxidation resistance, and corrosion resistance</strong>, making them a viable alternative to traditional NdFeB (Neodymium-Iron-Boron) magnets.This steady growth can be attributed to the rising demand in industrial applications, such as:</span></p>
