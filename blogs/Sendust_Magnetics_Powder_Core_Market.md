 <p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Market Size</strong></span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Sendust magnetics powder cores</strong> are specialized magnetic materials composed of an alloy consisting of <strong>6% aluminum, 9% silicon, and 85% iron.</strong> These cores are known for their <strong>low core losses</strong>, <strong>excellent temperature stability</strong>, and <strong>minimal magnetostriction,</strong> which significantly reduces audible noise in electrical applications. Sendust cores exhibit a saturation flux density of around <strong>1 Tesla</strong> and tend to lose inductance with increasing temperature.</span></p>
