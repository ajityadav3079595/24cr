<h1>Metal Recycling Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>The? global metal recycling market? was valued at USD 292,860 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 375,127.02 million by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 3.60% during the forecast period.</strong></span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Metal recycling</strong> refers to the process of recovering scrap metal from various sources and reprocessing it into new metal products. The main goal of metal recycling is to reduce the environmental impact associated with mining and manufacturing new metal products by reusing and reprocessing scrap metals.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:14px">Scrap metals are sourced from a variety of industries, including automotive, construction, electronics, and manufacturing. These metals are typically separated into ferrous (iron and steel) and non-ferrous (aluminum, copper, lead, etc.) categories before being processed into new forms. Recycling processes involve melting, refining, and alloying to create usable raw materials that can be used in new products.</span></p>
