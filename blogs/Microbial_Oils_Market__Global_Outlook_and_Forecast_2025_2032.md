<h1>Microbial Oils Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:14px">Microbial oil, also referred to as single-cell oil, is derived from oleaginous microorganisms such as bacteria, molds, algae, and yeast. These microorganisms are capable of accumulating significant amounts of intracellular lipids, primarily in the form of triacylglycerols (TAGs), which resemble the composition of vegetable oils. These oils have become a key area of interest due to their potential as a sustainable and renewable resource for various industries, including food, biofuels, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:14px">Microbial oils are produced when oleaginous microorganisms accumulate lipids, typically at the end of their logarithmic growth phase and continuing during the stationary phase when there is a reduction in the carbon source and other nutrients. The ability to accumulate 20% to 80% lipids by biomass makes microbial oils highly efficient and a promising substitute for traditional vegetable oils. The global demand for microbial oils has risen as industries look for more sustainable, eco-friendly alternatives to conventional oils and fats.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>The global microbial oils? market size was estimated at USD 74,660 million, and it is projected to reach USD 103,661.37 million by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 4.80% during the forecast period.</strong></span></p>
