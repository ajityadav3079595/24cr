<h1>Sludge Dispersant Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:13px">Sludge dispersants are chemical agents used to break down and disperse sludge in various industrial processes, primarily in the petroleum and water treatment sectors. These dispersants work by breaking water-in-oil emulsions and improving the flow properties of residual fuels, making them more homogeneous for combustion processes. In essence, sludge dispersants are designed to enhance the efficiency of energy production by making residual fuel oil more effective in combustion engines, reducing the risks of fuel clogging, and improving overall performance.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p>Sludge dispersants are widely used in the maritime, energy, and oil & gas industries, where heavy fuel oils are a standard energy source.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The global sludge dispersant market was valued at <strong>USD 174 million in 2023</strong> and is expected to reach <strong>USD 235.21 million by 2030</strong>, growing at a <strong><strong>CAGR</strong> of 4.40%</strong> during the forecast period. This growth is driven by the increasing demand for high-quality fuels, the need to improve combustion efficiency, and the growing concern over environmental impacts in energy industries.</p>
