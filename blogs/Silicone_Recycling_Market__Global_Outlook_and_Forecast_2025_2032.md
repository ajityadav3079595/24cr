<h1>Silicone Recycling Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong style="font-size:13px">Silicone recycling</strong> refers to the process of repurposing silicone materials from industrial, consumer, and commercial waste streams into usable products. Silicone, a versatile polymer with Si-C bonds and organic groups, is widely used in applications such as construction, healthcare, electronics, and personal care. Recycling silicone helps minimize environmental waste, conserve resources, and reduce the carbon footprint of production processes.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:14px">Recycled silicone can be processed into various forms, including <strong>silicone oils</strong>, <strong>rubbers</strong>, and <strong>resins</strong>, to create new products for industrial and consumer markets. The process often involves cleaning, shredding, and repolymerization, ensuring the material retains its functional properties.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>The global Silicone Recycling market was valued at USD 55 million in 2023 and is expected to grow to USD 73.85 million by 2030, registering a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 4.30% during the forecast period.</strong></span></p>
