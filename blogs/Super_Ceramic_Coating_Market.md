 <p><span style="font-size:14px">Super ceramic coating is a semi-permanent or permanent coating that is applied to the exterior of a vehicle to prevent damage to the exterior paintwork. It is a nanoscale paint treatment that is applied in liquid form but cures to form a hard layer over vehicle paint. It is usually composed of silicon dioxide (SiO2), which is usually derived from natural materials including quartz and sand. When chemicals combine with car paint, they create a hydrophobic (water-repellent) effect. Providing ceramic coatings to vehicle paintwork can help protect and restore your vehicle&#39;s paint job, leaving your car looking sparkling.</span></p>
