<h1>Nd-Fe-B Magnet Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:13px">The global </span><strong>Nd-Fe-B Magnet Market</strong><span style="font-size:13px"> refers to the market for </span><strong>Neodymium-Iron-Boron (Nd-Fe-B)</strong><span style="font-size:13px"> magnets, which are high-performance rare-earth magnets primarily used in various applications that require strong and durable magnetic properties. Sintered Nd-Fe-B magnets are manufactured from a blend of raw materials, including neodymium, iron, and boron, which are melted under vacuum or inert atmospheres and processed into strips. These strips are then pulverized into a fine powder and compacted under high pressure to form the final magnet product.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p>These magnets are characterized by their high energy density, strong magnetic force, and excellent stability at high temperatures, making them suitable for a wide range of industrial, automotive, and consumer electronic applications. Due to the critical role of rare-earth elements like neodymium, the market is influenced by the global supply of these materials and the demand across industries such as electronics, renewable energy, automotive, and more.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The global Nd-Fe-B Magnet market was valued at approximately <strong>USD 1,369 million</strong> in 2023. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (<strong><strong>CAGR</strong></strong>) of <strong>8.00%</strong> during the forecast period, reaching <strong>USD 2,346.23 million</strong> by 2030. This growth is primarily driven by the increasing demand for high-performance magnets in industries like automotive (particularly electric vehicles), electronics, and energy storage solutions.</p>
