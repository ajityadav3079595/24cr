<h1>Sintered NdFeB Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:13px">Sintered Neodymium magnets, also known as Sintered NdFeB (Neodymium-Iron-Boron) magnets, are high-performance permanent magnets manufactured through a meticulous process. This involves melting raw materials under a vacuum or inert atmosphere, forming Nd-Fe-B alloy strips via a strip caster, and cooling them rapidly. These strips are then pulverized into fine powder (microns in size) and pressed to create dense magnetic blocks. Known for their exceptional magnetic properties, such as high remanence and coercivity, sintered NdFeB magnets are critical in various applications, including electric vehicles (EVs), wind turbines, consumer electronics, and medical devices.</span></p>
