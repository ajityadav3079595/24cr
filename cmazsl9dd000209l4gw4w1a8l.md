# SBR Granules Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>SBR (Styrene Butadiene Rubber) granules are small particles of synthetic rubber derived from the copolymerization of styrene and butadiene. These granules are renowned for their durability, elasticity, and abrasion resistance, making them a popular choice for a wide range of applications. One of their primary uses is as infill material in artificial turf and sports surfaces, providing cushioning and improved traction. Additionally, SBR granules are utilized in flooring, playgrounds, and shock-absorbing mats due to their excellent impact resistance and cost-effectiveness.</p><p>
