</p><p>The <strong>Global Nonwovens for Hygiene Market</strong> refers to the industry involved in the production and distribution of nonwoven fabrics specifically designed for hygiene applications. Nonwovens are engineered fabrics made from fibers bonded together through mechanical, thermal, or chemical processes, rather than weaving or knitting. These materials are widely used in hygiene products due to their lightweight, absorbent, and disposable nature.</p><p>
</p><p>Key products in this market include <strong>diapers, feminine hygiene products, adult incontinence products, and wet wipes</strong>. Nonwovens offer advantages such as high breathability, softness, and liquid retention, making them ideal for hygiene applications. The market is characterized by continuous innovation, with manufacturers focusing on developing eco-friendly and sustainable nonwoven materials to meet evolving consumer preferences and regulatory requirements.</p><p>
