</p><p>Tetrahydrocurcumin (CAS 36062-04-1) is a natural compound derived from curcumin, the main active ingredient found in turmeric. Curcumin is well-known for its bright yellow color, while tetrahydrocurcumin has a lighter and more pale yellow or off-white color compared to curcumin. Tetrahydrocurcumin is an antioxidant and skin-whitening ingredient. It can effectively inhibit the generation of tyrosinase and oxygen free radicals and clear the formed free radicals, which has obvious antioxidant effect, and has been used as natural functional whitening raw materials in the research and development of cosmetics. Tetrahydrocurcumin is also a major curcuminoid metabolite of curcumin that has been shown to have protective effects against diabetes and vascular dysfunction via alleviation of oxidative stress. Also, many in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed that tetrahydrocurcumin exerts anti-cancer effects through various mechanisms, including modulation of oxidative stress, xenobiotic detoxification, inflammation, proliferation, metastasis, programmed cell death, and immunity.</p><p>
