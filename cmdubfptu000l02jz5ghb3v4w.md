# Global Zinc EDTA Market Research Report 2025

<p>The global Zinc EDTA market was valued at <strong>US$ 142 million in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>US$ 224 million by 2032</strong>, exhibiting a <strong>Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 0.059</strong> during the forecast period (2025–2032). This growth is driven by increasing demand for high-quality agricultural products and the need for efficient micronutrient fertilizers. The market has shown steady growth over the past decade, with significant investments in agricultural technology and sustainable farming practices contributing to its expansion. The rising awareness about soil health and plant nutrition is also a key factor propelling the market forward.</p><p>
</p><p>Zinc EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is a chelated form of zinc, widely used as a micronutrient fertilizer in agriculture. It is a stable compound that ensures zinc remains available to plants in a soluble form, preventing deficiencies that can lead to stunted growth and reduced crop yields. Zinc EDTA is particularly effective in alkaline soils where zinc is often unavailable to plants. The product is available in two primary forms: <strong>Purity ≥99%</strong> and <strong>Purity &lt;99%</strong>, each catering to specific agricultural needs. Its applications span across various crops, including grains, vegetables, fruits, and other agricultural produce, making it a versatile solution for modern farming.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
