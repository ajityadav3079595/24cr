</p><p><strong>Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA), a four-carbon non-protein amino acid, is a naturally occurring neurotransmitter found extensively in plants, animals, and microorganisms. It is primarily produced via the decarboxylation of glutamic acid by the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase. GABA functions as a principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), playing a crucial role in reducing neuronal excitability and regulating mood, stress, and anxiety. In the food and pharmaceutical industries, GABA is valued for its health-promoting effects, particularly its calming properties and its potential to support mental wellness. Naturally occurring in various fermented foods, GABA is considered safe and eco-friendly, making it attractive for inclusion in functional foods, dietary supplements, and pharmaceutical formulations.</strong></p><p>
