The approval process for new herbal ingredients is often lengthy and expensive, with costs exceeding $500,000 for comprehensive safety studies. These regulatory barriers discourage small and medium enterprises from entering the market and limit product innovation in developed markets.</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Limited Consumer Awareness in Western Markets</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Despite growing interest in herbal supplements, consumer awareness of andrographis remains limited in Western markets. Market research indicates that less than 30% of U.S. supplement users are familiar with andrographis, compared to 85% awareness for echinacea or ginseng. This lack of awareness makes it difficult for manufacturers to build brand recognition and justify premium pricing. The bitter taste of andrographis extract also presents formulation challenges, particularly for consumer products like functional foods and beverages. Without significant investment in consumer education and product innovation, market penetration in North America and Europe may remain limited compared to Asian markets where the herb is well-established.</p><p>
<strong>MARKET OPPORTUNITIES</strong></p><p>
