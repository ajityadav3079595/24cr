</p><p>This slow but steady growth is attributed to the increasing push for lightweight materials that enhance fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. While the automotive sector remains the largest consumer, demand is also rising from construction and marine applications.</p><p>
</p><p>Despite supply chain constraints and cost-related challenges in 2020–2021, the GMT market rebounded strongly with the revitalization of the automotive and aerospace industries, particularly in North America and Europe. Furthermore, Asia-Pacific is emerging as a key growth engine, driven by large-scale industrialization and increasing investments in lightweight composite materials.</p><p>
</p><p>Glass Mat Thermoplastic Composite (GMT) refers to a class of composite materials composed of glass fiber mats embedded within a thermoplastic resin matrix, such as polypropylene (PP) or polyamide (PA). These composites are produced via compression molding and are appreciated for their superior strength-to-weight ratio, recyclability, and resistance to impact, chemicals, and corrosion.</p><p>
</p><p>Unlike thermoset composites, GMTs offer reprocessability and shorter cycle times, making them ideal for high-volume production. Their unique properties make them a preferred material in automotive structures (like underbody shields, front-end carriers, and seat backs), as well as in building components, marine panels, and other industrial applications.</p><p>
