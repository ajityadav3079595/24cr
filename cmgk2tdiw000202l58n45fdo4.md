# Refrigerant R134A Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Refrigerant R134a, also known as tetrafluoroethane (CF3CH2F), is a hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant used primarily as a substitute for R-12 CFC refrigerant in refrigeration and air conditioning applications. R134a is non-toxic, non-flammable, and non-corrosive, making it safe for handling and use. The refrigerant is widely used in systems such as centrifugal, rotary screw, scroll, and reciprocating compressors. It is not directly compatible with R-12 lubricants and mineral-based refrigerants, necessitating design changes to the condenser and evaporator for optimal performance.</p><p>
