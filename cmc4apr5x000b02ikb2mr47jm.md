</p><p>In the North American region, the market size was estimated at USD 45.82 million in 2023, with a projected CAGR of 6.86% during the forecast period. These figures highlight increasing demand across multiple industries for lightweight, high-strength materials that improve structural performance while minimizing overall weight.</p><p>
</p><p>Composite Honeycomb Core Sandwich Panels are advanced materials made by bonding two high-rigidity face sheets with a lightweight, low-density honeycomb core. These panels offer an exceptional strength-to-weight ratio, making them an ideal solution where weight savings and mechanical performance are critical. The core material, often made of aluminum, aramid, or thermoplastic, is sandwiched between composite laminates—commonly referred to as "skins." These skins and core combinations make the panels superior to solid composite laminates in applications requiring high structural strength and minimal weight.</p><p>
