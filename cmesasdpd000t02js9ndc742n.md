<strong>Competitive Analysis </strong></p><p>
</p><p>
<strong>Recent Development</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>March 1st 2024, </strong>Yara, a leading Norwegian crop nutrition company and a global leader in ammonia trade and shipping, and GHC SAOC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Acme Cleantech, a leading renewable energy company in India, today signed a firm and binding agreement for supply of ammonia with reduced CO2 emissions from Acme to Yara on a long-term basis.</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>May 25th 2022,</strong> LSB Industries, Inc. announced that it entered into agreements with ThyssenKrupp Uhde USA, LLC and Bloom Energy, to develop a project to produce approximately 30,000 metric tons of zero-carbon or “green” ammonia per year at LSB’s Pryor, Oklahoma facility (“Pryor”). Green ammonia is produced by extracting hydrogen from water using an electrolyzer powered by a renewable energy source, such as solar or wind. Since no natural gas or other fossil fuels are used as the feedstock to the ammonia production process, nor as the power source, the end-product has no associated carbon emissions.</p><p>
<strong>Industry Dynamics</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Industry Drivers</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Decarbonization and Climate Goals</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:justify">Meeting global climate targets has made decarbonization a top priority, especially for sectors like ammonia production that mostly depend on carbon-intensive operations. Conventional ammonia production techniques, such the Haber-Bosch process, need a lot of energy and mostly fossil fuels, which results in considerable carbon emissions. The objectives of the Paris Agreement, which aim to keep global warming far below 2°C, ideally 1.5°C, above pre-industrial levels, are at odds with conventional ammonia production because of this dependency.</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:justify">A possible, carbon-neutral substitute is green ammonia, which is generated from renewable energy sources like hydropower, solar power, or wind. The production process for green ammonia can reduce carbon emissions by employing green hydrogen produced from water electrolysis driven by renewable energy, supporting national and corporate decarbonization goals. Thus, switching to green ammonia is in line with the climate objectives of numerous countries and businesses that are dedicated to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 or earlier.</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:justify">Green ammonia adoption can drastically lower carbon footprints for supply chains in the energy, maritime, and agricultural sectors—all of which are major users of ammonia and products generated from it. Green ammonia can also function as a flexible energy transporter, possibly facilitating hydrogen transfer and energy storage. Green ammonia's importance in the shift to sustainable energy systems is further enhanced by its adaptability, which establishes it as a vital component of international efforts to meet climate and decarbonization goals.</p><p>
<strong>Industry Restraint</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:justify">The expansion of green ammonia production and the improvement of its cost competitiveness depend heavily on technological developments in electrolysis technology. Efficiency, durability, and cost-effectiveness have been significantly improved using Alkaline Water Electrolysis (AWE), Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis (PEM WE), and Solid Oxide Electrolysis (SOE). With improved catalysts and materials that increase operating life and boost energy conversion efficiency, AWE—which is renowned for its durability and affordability—is developing. PEM WE is gaining from advancements in membrane materials and electrode architectures, which improve performance and lower prices, thanks to its quick reaction times and small size. With advancements in electrochemical materials and system integration, SOE—which can use waste heat and runs at high temperatures—is becoming more efficient overall. These technological strides are making electrolysis-based green hydrogen production more economically viable, directly contributing to the competitiveness of green ammonia, which is essential for decarbonizing agriculture, energy, and other industries.</p><p>
<strong>Industry Restraint</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:justify">Green ammonia production is now more costly than regular ammonia, mostly because of the high expenses of infrastructure, electrolysis equipment, and renewable energy. Green ammonia is created by electrolyzing water to produce hydrogen using renewable energy sources like sun or wind. The infrastructure for renewable energy and the electrolysis apparatus both require a significant amount of capital. Electrolyzers, particularly those used in Solid Oxide Electrolysis (SOE) and Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM), are expensive initially because they need sophisticated materials and great precision to function effectively. Further complexity and expense are added when these electrolyzers are integrated with ammonia synthesis facilities, such as the Haber-Bosch process. While renewable energy costs are decreasing, they remain a significant factor in the overall expense of green ammonia. This makes large-scale commercialization difficult without substantial subsidies or reductions in technology costs. As innovations continue and economies of scale are realized, these costs are expected to decrease, making green ammonia more competitive with traditional ammonia.</p><p>
