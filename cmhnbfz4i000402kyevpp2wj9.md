# Kitchen Engineered Quartz Stone Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>East Engineered Quartz Stone (EQS) is made from either a natural slab that has been polished or engineered quartz composite. Quartz is one of the hardest natural materials on earth and has an appearance similar to granite. It is comprised of silicon dioxide. Pure, natural quartz slabs are very expensive and are therefore quite uncommon as countertops. The engineered type is made of 93 to 97 percent ground quartz combined with resins, binders, and pigments. This combination is poured into molds and allowed to harden, then finished into the shape and style desired.</p><p>
