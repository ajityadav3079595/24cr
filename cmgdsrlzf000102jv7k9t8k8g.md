Historical trends indicate a steady increase in the use of ferrous sulfate due to its cost-effectiveness and compatibility with sustainable agricultural practices. Additionally, regions such as Asia-Pacific and Latin America are showing a marked increase in demand, driven by population growth and government initiatives promoting soil health.</p><p>
</p><p>Ferrous sulfate, also known as iron(II) sulfate, is an essential micronutrient utilized extensively in agriculture to address iron deficiencies in crops and soil. Iron is a vital element required for chlorophyll synthesis, and its deficiency often results in chlorosisa yellowing of leaves due to inadequate chlorophyll. Ferrous sulfate can be applied directly to soil, blended with fertilizers, or used as a foliar spray to promote healthy plant growth and increase crop yield. Its use spans various crop types, including cereals, legumes, fruits, and vegetables, particularly in regions with calcareous or alkaline soils where iron availability is naturally limited.</p><p>
