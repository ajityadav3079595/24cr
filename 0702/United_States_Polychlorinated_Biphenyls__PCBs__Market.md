<h1>United States Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) Market Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs)</strong> are synthetic organic chemicals that were widely used in industrial and commercial applications due to their chemical stability, non-flammability, and insulating properties. Commonly found in electrical equipment like transformers and capacitors, PCBs were banned in the United States in 1979 under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) due to their environmental persistence and potential health hazards. Today, the United States PCB market focuses predominantly on remediation, disposal, and environmental cleanup efforts, given their classification as persistent organic pollutants (POPs).</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">The "<strong>United States Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) Market"</strong> was valued at <strong>US$ 98.4 million in 2024</strong> and is projected to decline to <strong>US$ 76.5 million by 2030</strong>, registering a <strong><strong>CAGR</strong> of -4.1%</strong> during the forecast period (2024-2030). The contraction in market size is driven by stringent environmental regulations, the completion of major cleanup projects, and the declining presence of PCB-contaminated sites. Historical data from 2019 to 2023 illustrates consistent reductions in PCB-related activities, with a shift towards advanced detection technologies and cost-effective remediation solutions. Cleanup projects, which account for approximately <strong>80%</strong> of market activity, remain the primary revenue driver.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Stringent Environmental Regulations</strong>: Compliance with federal laws like the TSCA and international conventions such as the Stockholm Convention continues to drive demand for remediation and disposal services.</span></p>
