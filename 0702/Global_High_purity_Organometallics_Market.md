 <p><strong>Report Overview</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>High-purity organometallics are organometallics that are highly pure and that are widely used as catalysts or reagents in various commercial chemical reactions. High-purity organometallics contain metals and organic ligands and they form a complex organometallic framework. They are class of chemical compounds containing one or more metal atoms bonded directly to one or more carbon atoms. They are volatile in nature and they are soluble in organic solvents. High-purity organometallics have superior electric and magnetic properties. Commercially, they are available in both liquid and solid forms. High-purity organometallics are primarily used in electronics applications. In the pharmaceutical and industrial applications, they are used as chemical catalysts or reagents. Commonly used high-purity organometallics include high-purity organoaluminum, high-purity organomagnesium, and high-purity organolithium. High purity organometallics influence the speed and characteristics of chemical reactions</p>
