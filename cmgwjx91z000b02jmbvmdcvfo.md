# Global Recycled Polyester (rPET) Market Research Report 2025-2032

<p>The global recycled polyester (rPET) market was valued at <strong>US$ 8.45 billion in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>US$ 16.7 billion by 2032</strong>, growing at a <strong>Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 8.9%</strong> during the forecast period (2025–2032). The market is driven by increasing demand for sustainable materials, stringent environmental regulation, and growing consumer awareness about eco-friendly products. The textile and packaging industries are the primary contributors to this growth, with rPET being widely used in apparel, industrial applications, and other sectors.</p><p>
</p><p>Recycled polyester (rPET) is a sustainable alternative to virgin polyester, produced by recycling post-consumer PET bottles and industrial waste. The process involves collecting, cleaning, and melting PET waste to create new polyester fiber or pellets. rPET retains the same properties as virgin polyester, including durability, strength, and versatility, while significantly reducing environmental impact. It is widely used in textiles, packaging, automotive, and construction industries. The adoption of rPET helps reduce carbon emissions, conserve natural resources, and minimize plastic waste, making it a key component of the circular economy.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
