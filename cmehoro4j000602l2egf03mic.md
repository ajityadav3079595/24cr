# Porous Ceramics Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Porous ceramics refer to a class of advanced ceramic materials characterized by a high percentage of porosity, typically ranging between 20% and 95%. These materials consist of a solid ceramic phase combined with a gas-filled porous phase, making them lightweight, thermally insulating, and permeable to gases and liquids. They are widely used in filtration, catalysis, insulation, and biomedical applications due to their exceptional thermal and chemical stability.</p><p>
