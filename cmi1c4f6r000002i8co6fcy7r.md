# Beta-Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) Market, Global Outlook & Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Beta-Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) is an intermediate compound in the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). It is derived from nicotinamide through the enzymatic action of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT). NMN has gained significant attention due to its potential role in anti-aging and its applications in preventing age-related diseases, including diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular conditions. With ongoing research and increasing consumer interest in longevity solutions, NMN has emerged as a critical component in health and wellness products.</p><p>
