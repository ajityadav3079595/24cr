</p><p>SiOx barrier film is a high-performance transparent plastic film with a silicon oxide (SiOx) coating applied via vacuum deposition. The SiOx layer, typically 40-80 nanometers thick, provides superior gas barrier properties, making it ideal for applications requiring protection against oxygen and moisture. The film is commonly used with substrates such as PET, OPA, and BOPP. The deposition process involves sublimating solid silicon oxide using an electron beam, followed by vapor condensation on a cooled film roll. This results in a thin, crystal-clear barrier layer that enhances the film's protective capabilities while maintaining transparency and flexibility.</p><p>
