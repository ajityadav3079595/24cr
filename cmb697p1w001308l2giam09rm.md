# Global Recycled Polyester Staple Fibre Market Research Report 2025-2032

<p>The global recycled polyester staple fiber market was valued at <strong>US$ 3.6 billion in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>US$ 6.5 billion by 2032</strong>, exhibiting a <strong>Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7.7%</strong> during the forecast period (2025–2032). The market is experiencing significant growth due to increasing environmental awareness, stringent government regulations, and rising demand for sustainable textile materials. The market has shown steady growth over the past decade, driven by the shift toward circular economy models in the textile and apparel industry.</p><p>
</p><p>Recycled polyester staple fiber (RPSF) is a synthetic fiber derived from post-consumer PET bottles, industrial polyester waste, or textile waste. It undergoes mechanical or chemical recycling processes to produce fibers that can be used in various applications. RPSF is widely used in the textile industry for producing fabrics, non-woven materials, and other applications. The key advantage of RPSF is its reduced environmental impact compared to virgin polyester, as it lowers energy consumption and carbon emissions. The fiber is available in two primary forms: <strong>solid fiber</strong> and <strong>hollow fiber</strong>, each catering to different end-use industries.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
