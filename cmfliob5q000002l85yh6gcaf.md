# Ethylene Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Ethylene (C2H4) is a hydrocarbon compound classified as an alkene, characterized by a carbon-carbon double bond. It is one of the most widely produced organic compounds globally, serving as a key building block in the petrochemical industry. Ethylene is primarily derived from sources such as ethane, naphtha, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) through steam cracking. It is extensively utilized in producing polyethylene (PE), ethylene oxide/ethylene glycol (EO/EG), styrene monomer (SM), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and other chemicals.</p><p>
