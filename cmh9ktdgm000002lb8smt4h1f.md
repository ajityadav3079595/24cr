# Clad Pipes Market, Global Outlook & Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Clad pipes are composite pipes that feature a metallurgical bond between the base pipe and a corrosion-resistant cladding material. This cladding process can be achieved through various methods, including roll bonding, explosion bonding, weld overlay, and mechanical bonding. These pipes are primarily used in industries that require high corrosion resistance, such as oil &amp; gas, chemical processing, and water treatment. The combination of high-strength carbon steel with corrosion-resistant alloys like stainless steel, nickel-based alloys, and titanium ensures durability and cost-effectiveness.</p><p>
