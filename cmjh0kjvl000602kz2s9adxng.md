# Sponge Titanium Market, Global Outlook & Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Sponge titanium is a highly pure form of titanium metal produced through the Kroll process, where titanium tetrachloride is reduced using magnesium or sodium. The material is widely used in aerospace, defense, chemical processing, and marine applications due to its lightweight, corrosion resistance, and high strength-to-weight ratio. Sponge titanium serves as the primary raw material for titanium ingots and subsequent products such as sheets, bars, and powders used across various industries.</p><p>
