</p><p>Sodium triflate, also known as sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate or NaOTf, is a chemical compound with the formula CF3SO2Na. It is a white or colorless solid that is highly soluble in water and many organic solvents. Sodium triflate is commonly used as a catalyst and a reagent in organic synthesis, particularly in the formation of carbon-carbon bonds and the protection of functional groups. It is also used in the production of certain pharmaceuticals and electronic materials. Due to its strong acidity and hygroscopic nature, sodium triflate should be handled with care and stored in a dry, airtight container.</p><p>
