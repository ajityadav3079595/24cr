Furthermore, the home fragrance segment is driving demand for citrus-based essential oil blends, particularly in North America and Europe.</p><p>
<strong>MARKET RESTRAINTS</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Phototoxicity Concerns to Limit Widespread Adoption</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Despite its benefits, citrus limon peel oil faces challenges due to its phototoxic properties caused by furanocoumarins. These compounds can cause skin irritation and increased sensitivity to UV radiation when applied topically, limiting its use in certain cosmetics and personal care products.

<strong>Other Trends</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Growing Application in Food and Beverage Industry</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The expanding use of Citrus Limon Peel Oil in the food and beverage sector is another key trend shaping the market. With consumers demanding clean-label products free from artificial flavors, lemon peel oil serves as a natural alternative for enhancing taste in beverages, confectionery, and baked goods.
