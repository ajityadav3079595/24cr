# Global Tiapride Market Research Report 2025-2032

<p>The global Tiapride market was valued at <strong>US$ 87 million in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>US$ 132 million by 2032</strong>, exhibiting a <strong>Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 5.3%</strong> during the forecast period (2025–2032). This growth trajectory is supported by increasing demand for Tiapride in treating conditions such as alcoholism, agitation, aggression, and movement disorder. The market has shown steady expansion over the past decade, driven by rising healthcare expenditure and the growing prevalence of neurological and psychiatric disorders. The forecasted growth is also attributed to advancements in pharmaceutical formulation and expanding applications in emerging markets.</p><p>
</p><p>Tiapride is a selective dopamine D2 and D3 receptor antagonist primarily used in the treatment of <strong>alcoholism, agitation, aggression, and movement disorder</strong>. It belongs to the benzamide class of antipsychotics and is known for its efficacy in managing psychomotor agitation and dyskinesias. The drug is available in various forms, including powder and liquid, catering to different therapeutic needs. Tiapride's mechanism of action involves modulating dopaminergic pathways, which makes it particularly effective in conditions where dopamine dysregulation is a key factor. The market for Tiapride is influenced by its widespread use in both developed and developing regions, with increasing adoption in clinical settings.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
