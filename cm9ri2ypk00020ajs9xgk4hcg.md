A catalyst generally refers to a substance that increases the rate of a reaction without changing the total standard Gibbs free energy change of the reaction. It can also be expressed as a substance that can increase the chemical reaction rate in a chemical reaction without changing the chemical balance, and its own quality and chemical properties have not changed before and after the chemical reaction. According to statistics, more than 90% of industrial processes use catalysts, such as chemical, petrochemical, biochemical, and environmental protection.</p><p>
