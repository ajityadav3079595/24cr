A hydrolysed plant protein is a protein derived from boiling cereals or legumes in hydrochloric acid and then neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide. This process breaks down the protein into smaller peptides, making it easier to digest and absorb in the human body. Hydrolysed plant proteins are commonly used in food products to enhance flavor, texture, and nutritional value.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
