# Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cells Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC), also known as polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells, are a type of fuel cell designed primarily for transport applications, as well as for stationary and portable fuel-cell applications. These fuel cells operate at relatively low temperatures (50-100°C) and utilize a proton-conducting polymer electrolyte membrane. Unlike traditional fuel cells, PEMFCs generate electricity through an electrochemical process without combustion, making them an environmentally friendly alternative. Their ability to provide high power density, rapid startup times, and efficiency makes them a strong candidate for replacing aging alkaline fuel-cell technology, previously used in aerospace applications like the Space Shuttle.</p><p>
