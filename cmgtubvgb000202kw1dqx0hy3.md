As prefabrication claims an increasing share of construction activity, this synergy presents opportunities to expand FRP use beyond traditional applications.</p><p>
<strong>MARKET CHALLENGES</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Workforce Training Gaps Impede Market Penetration</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The construction industry's limited familiarity with FRP reinforcement techniques creates implementation challenges. Unlike steel rebar installation which follows well-established practices, FRP requires specialized cutting tools and handling procedures. Many contractors lack experience with these techniques, leading to installation errors that compromise structural performance. The industry needs comprehensive training programs to bridge this knowledge gap across all levels - from engineers to field crews.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Other Challenges</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Perception Issues Among Conservative Construction Professionals</strong></p><p>
Deep-rooted preferences for traditional materials persist throughout the construction value chain. Many structural engineers remain skeptical about FRP's long-term performance despite extensive testing data. Overcoming this mindset requires continuous education and demonstration projects that showcase successful FRP implementations across different applications.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Temperature Sensitivity Limits Certain Applications</strong></p><p>
While FRP offers excellent corrosion resistance, its performance at elevated temperatures requires careful consideration. The polymer matrix begins to soften at temperatures exceeding 150Â°C, potentially compromising structural integrity in fire scenarios. This characteristic restricts FRP use in applications where fire resistance is paramount, unless protective measures are implemented.</p><p>
