These additives improve the melt flow, surface quality, and mechanical properties of PVC products. Processing aids reduce melt fracture, enhance fusion, and minimize die build-up during extrusion, injection molding, and other manufacturing processes. They are widely used in rigid and flexible PVC applications, including pipes, profiles, films, sheets, and wire coatings.</p><p>
