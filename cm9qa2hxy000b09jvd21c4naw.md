# Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Potassium hydroxide (KOH), commonly referred to as caustic potash, is an inorganic compound that appears as an odorless, white or slightly yellow, flakey, or lumpy solid. It is highly soluble in water and forms a strong alkaline solution. KOH is widely used in various industries, including chemical manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and agriculture. Its strong alkaline properties make it essential in the production of biodiesel, soaps, and detergents, among other applications.</p><p>
