# DPG (1,3-Diphenylguanidine) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p><strong>As of 2023, the global DPG (1,3-Diphenylguanidine) market was valued at USD 92 million. It is projected to grow steadily and reach USD 127.58 million by 2032, expanding at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 3.70% during the forecast period from 2024 to 2032.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>This growth is primarily driven by rising global demand for rubber products in automotive, industrial, and consumer sectors. The automotive industry, in particular, remains a significant growth contributor due to the continual production of tires and rubber components. The North American market was valued at USD 25.52 million in 2023, with an expected CAGR of 3.17% during the forecast years.</strong></p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

</p><p><strong>Historically, DPG demand has seen consistent growth, supported by the expansion of the rubber manufacturing base across Asia-Pacific, especially in China and India. Furthermore, the growing trend toward high-performance, eco-friendly tires is expected to fuel further demand for specialty rubber chemicals such as DPG.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>DPG (1,3-Diphenylguanidine) is an organic compound widely used as a vulcanization accelerator in the rubber industry. As a synthesis intermediate, DPG serves a crucial function in speeding up the vulcanization process—the chemical reaction that improves the elasticity and durability of rubber. Vulcanization is essential for producing tires, conveyor belts, footwear soles, hoses, and other rubber-based industrial and consumer products.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>DPG is often used in combination with thiazole accelerators like MBT and MBTS to enhance rubber properties such as resilience and tensile strength. Additionally, DPG offers low toxicity, moderate curing speed, and effective crosslinking ability, making it a preferred choice among rubber manufacturers. While its primary application is in the rubber industry, DPG also plays a supporting role in certain adhesives and resins.</strong></p><p>
