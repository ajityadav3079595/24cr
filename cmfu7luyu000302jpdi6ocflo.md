# Ethylene Price Trend, Spot Prices, Historical and Forecast Price Movement Charts, 2025 Edition

<p>In January 2025, Ethylene prices demonstrated regional variability due to increased demand from various industries and changing weather conditions across countries. The Ethylene price in the APAC region in 2024 saw a constant decrease which has been influenced by various factors, the market has been impacted by the weak demand from industries such as the Polyethylene sector.
The FOB South Korea price in October 2024 was around 750-850 USD/Ton. While the FOB Japan ethylene price was valued at around 910 USD/Ton.
Further, the CFR China Ethylene price was assessed at 800- 900 USD/Tons in January 2025.  Rising feedstock costs and a rebound in demand caused an initial price increase in China's ethylene market in 2024. However, this trend reversed in the later half of the year, with prices falling due to domestic production capacity expansion exceeding demand and worldwide oversupply.
Prior to notable turnarounds in H1 2025, US ethylene producers have been accumulating, which has caused US spot prices to reach nearly three-month highs in December 2024. On December 6, Platts assessed the spot price of Mont Belvieu ethylene at 27.375 cents/lb FD, the highest since September 23 when it was set at 28 cents/lb.
Rapid price differences in ethylene across regions are attributed to differences in production costs, feedstock availability, transportation costs, and regional demand-supply dynamics. Ethylene production is highly dependent on feedstock such as naphtha, ethane, or propane, whose prices vary globally due to differences in crude oil and natural gas markets. For example, the Middle East enjoys cheap ethane from large gas reserves, making it possible to sell at relatively low prices. Asia, relying on naphtha from imported crude oil, usually pays higher production costs. Regional demand disparities, caused by industrial activity, infrastructure, and maturity of the market, also shape price trends. Transportation and logistics issues, such as freight cost, import-export tariffs, and geopolitical aspects, add further complexity to prices. Supply disruptions, including unscheduled plant shutdowns or trade policy changes, can also lead to short-term price increases or decreases and regional imbalances. These interlinked factors cause major and fast-moving changes in the ethylene price globally.
The pricing of Ethylene in 2025 is influenced by a variety of economic, industrial, and environmental factors. Key elements shaping the market include production cost, material cost, geo-political conditions, etc.
1. Energy Price: The petrochemical sector has been greatly influenced by high energy costs, especially in areas like Europe. Plant closures and a greater reliance on imports for essential chemicals are the results of rising energy costs and carbon fees. These elements can affect global ethylene pricing trends and lead to regional price differences.
2. Regulatory and Environment Policy: The chemical industry is expected to focus on innovation, sustainability, and resiliency to improve efficiency and growth in 2025. Hence, regulatory efforts to cut down carbon emissions and facilitate sustainable practices might influence production costs and operating strategies, affecting the price of ethylene.
3. Technological Advancement: New technologies, such as catalytic cracking and bio-based ethylene production, may reduce production costs and improve efficiency, influencing pricing. Regions investing in advanced technologies could gain a competitive edge, altering global price dynamics.
4. Energy Price: The high energy prices, especially in regions such as Europe, are currently impacting the petrochemical industries. With high energy cost increases and carbon taxes, the energy-intensive plants are getting closed, and significant numbers of vital chemicals rely increasingly on imports. All of this is causing regional price imbalances and influences the direction of global ethylene price trends.
5. Demand Supply Dynamics: The global ethylene market is projected to experience a significant oversupply due to substantial capacity expansions, particularly in China. This increase in production capacity is expected to surpass demand growth, exerting downward pressure on prices.
Ethylene acts as an essential building block in the petrochemical industry, with its demand driven by a broad range of applications throughout numerous industries. The production of polyethylene, the most common plastic, takes into account for a significant portion of ethylene consumption, as it is extensively used in packaging, consumer goods, and construction materials. Ethylene oxide, yet another significant derivative, is essential for producing ethylene glycol, that is utilized in antifreeze, polyester fibers, and resins. In addition, ethylene dichloride, a precursor to polyvinyl chloride (PVC), is crucial for pipes, cables, and flooring in construction. The growing demand for styrene, used in rubber, insulation, and automotive components, further bolsters ethylene consumption. With increasing urbanization and industrialization in emerging economies, coupled with the growing focus on lightweight and energy-efficient materials, ethylene demand is set to expand, particularly in packaging, automotive, and infrastructure sectors. Its role in bio-based and sustainable products also highlights its future relevance in a more environmentally conscious market.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
