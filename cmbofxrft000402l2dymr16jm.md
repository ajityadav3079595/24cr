# Potassium Carbonate Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Potassium carbonate (K2CO3), also known as potash carbonate, is a white, odorless inorganic compound commonly available in crystalline, granulated, or powder form. It is highly soluble in water, forming a strongly alkaline solution, and is used in a variety of industrial applications, including glass manufacturing, agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and the food industry. This versatile compound is primarily produced through electrolysis and ion exchange methods, with older techniques like the ash method becoming obsolete due to inefficiencies and environmental concerns</p><p>
