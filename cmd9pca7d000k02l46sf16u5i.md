<strong>Market Size</strong></p><p>
</p><p>This growth is driven by increasing NEV production, stringent environmental regulations, and the growing need for lightweight yet durable materials in vehicle manufacturing. Furthermore, advancements in battery technologies and an emphasis on sustainability bolster the demand for pre-nickel plated steel.</p><p>
</p><p>Pre-nickel plated steel refers to a specialized material where a thin layer of nickel is applied to steel before further processing. This pre-treatment enhances the steel's corrosion resistance, wear resistance, and overall durability, making it particularly valuable in the automotive industry, especially for new energy vehicles (NEVs). As NEVs require components with superior corrosion protection and longevity, pre-nickel plated steel plays a crucial role in battery casings, fuel cells, and structural reinforcements.</p><p>
