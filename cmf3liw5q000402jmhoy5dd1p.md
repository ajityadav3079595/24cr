# Podophyllin Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>The Podophyllin market revolves around the use of Podophyllin, a non-alkaloid toxin lignan derived from the roots and rhizomes of Podophyllum species. This substance has various medical applications, most notably as a topical treatment for external genital warts, which are caused by specific types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). Podophyllin is utilized under trade names like <strong style="font-size:13px">Condylox</strong> (gel form) and <strong style="font-size:13px">Wartec</strong> (solution or cream form). Beyond its use for warts, Podophyllin and its synthetic derivatives (such as etoposide and teniposide) find significant applications in treatments for various cancers, including lung cancer, lymphomas, and genital tumors. The compounds derived from Podophyllin also display properties such as purgative, vesicant, antirheumatic, antiviral, and antitumor agents, highlighting its versatile medicinal value.</p><p>
