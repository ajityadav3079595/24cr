</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Competition from Alternative Technologies Intensifies</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Advanced epoxy formulations and liquid silicone rubbers continue capturing niche applications with superior flow characteristics or temperature resistance. Epoxy compounds now claim 22% of the electronics encapsulation market, particularly where ultra-low viscosity (sub-500 cP) is required. Silicone alternatives dominate high-temperature (&gt;200Â°C continuous) applications, growing at 11% annually. Polyamide suppliers must continue innovating to maintain technical advantages in key performance parameters like chemical resistance and mechanical strength.</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Energy Intensive Production Faces Scrutiny</strong></p><p>
