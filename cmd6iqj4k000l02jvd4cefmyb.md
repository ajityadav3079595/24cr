</p><p>
</p><p>Mining companies are using 3D mine visualizers to obtain a real-time digital model of a mine. A 3D mine visualizer generates a three-dimensional model of the mine layout and transfers it directly to the operator. With a web-based interfaceinformation about the model is available with any connected device. It offers full record and playback capabilities in 3D thus allowing operators to review and analyze historical data in order to improve productivity and identify best practices. 3D mine visualizers significantly enhance the productivity of large mining environments. It is a valuable tool in operations planninganalyzing problematic areas and tracking mine development over time. Companies such as Sandvik and Komatsu are offering 3D visualizer systems.</p><p>
