<strong>Market Size</strong></p><p>
Poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) is an aliphatic polyester produced by the polymerization of 1,4-succinic acid and 1,4-butanediol. It is a biodegradable, environmentally friendly polymer with a variety of applications in industries such as packaging, agriculture, textiles, and medical devices. PBS is considered a sustainable alternative to traditional petroleum-based plastics due to its ability to be decomposed by microorganisms in the environment. This biodegradable nature makes PBS an ideal candidate for reducing plastic waste, aligning with growing global sustainability initiatives.</p><p>
</p><p>PBS can range in molecular weight, typically spanning tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands, and appears in a white or milky white form. The polymer has high thermal stability, mechanical strength, and flexibility, making it a highly versatile material for various end-use applications. As an eco-friendly alternative, PBS has garnered significant attention in recent years, as the demand for biodegradable and compostable materials rises, further driving its global market growth.</p><p>
