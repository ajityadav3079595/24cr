</p><p>Stainless Steel Abrasive, made from Cr-Ni alloyed stainless steel and Cr alloyed stainless steel scrap, can be categorized into Stainless Steel Shot and Stainless Steel Grit based on their external shape.</p><p>
</p><p>Compared to Cast Steel Abrasive, stainless steel variants have higher abrasion resistance and do not require acid cleaning for rust removal, reducing overall shot blasting costs. They are considered a favorable alternative to several other abrasives like Aluminum Oxide, Glass Bead, Silicon Carbide, Copper Slag, Garnet, and others.</p><p>
</p><p>Stainless Steel Abrasive refers to abrasive materials made from Cr-Ni alloyed stainless steel and Cr alloyed stainless steel scrap. These materials, including Stainless Steel Shot and Stainless Steel Grit, are widely used in shot blasting processes due to their high abrasion resistance and cost-effectiveness compared to cast steel options.</p><p>
