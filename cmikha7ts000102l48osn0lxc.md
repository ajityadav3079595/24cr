Industrial couplant is used to exclude the air between the probe and the measured object, so that the ultrasonic wave can effectively penetrate the workpiece to achieve the purpose of detection. If the type is selected or used improperly, it will cause errors or the coupling mark will flicker, making it impossible to measure. Due to the selection of the appropriate type according to the application, when using on a smooth material surface, you can use a low-viscosity coupling agent; when using on a rough surface, vertical surface and top surface, you should use a high-viscosity coupling agent. High temperature workpieces should use high temperature couplant. Secondly, the couplant should be used in an appropriate amount and applied evenly. Generally, the couplant should be applied to the surface of the material to be tested, but when the measurement temperature is high, the couplant should be applied to the probe.</p><p>
