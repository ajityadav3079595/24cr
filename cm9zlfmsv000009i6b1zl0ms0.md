</p><p>The Southeast Asia Zinc, Zinc Pigments and Salts market is experiencing steady growth, driven by increasing infrastructure development, growing automotive production, and expanding chemical and pharmaceutical industries across the region. In 2023, total consumption of zinc and zinc-based products in Southeast Asia reached approximately 2.1 million metric tons, with Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam accounting for 70% of regional demand. The galvanizing sector remains the largest consumer, representing 50% of demand, followed by rubber and tire manufacturing at 20%, and chemicals at 15%. The market saw a significant boost from the recovery of construction activities and infrastructure projects, leading to a 12% increase in demand for galvanized steel in 2023. Metallic zinc dominates the market with a 60% share, followed by zinc oxide at 25% and zinc salts at 15%. Technological advancements have focused on improving the efficiency of zinc production, enhancing the performance of zinc pigments, and developing specialized zinc compounds for emerging applications. New zinc oxide grades offer up to 30% higher UV absorption and 20% better antimicrobial properties compared to 2020 standards. The market is witnessing strong growth in nanostructured zinc oxides, increasing at 14% annually, driven by their applications in advanced coatings and electronics. In 2023, stricter environmental regulations led to a 15% increase in the adoption of zinc-rich primers as alternatives to chromate-based coatings. The industry faces challenges from fluctuating zinc prices and competition from alternative materials in some applications, but the versatility and essential nature of zinc-based products continue to drive demand across various sectors. Emerging applications in energy storage, particularly for zinc-air batteries, are showing significant promise, with specialized zinc powders for these applications growing at 20% CAGR, albeit from a small base of 3% market share. Looking ahead, the market is expected to benefit from innovations in sustainable zinc production and recycling technologies, with eco-friendly zinc products projected to grow at 10% CAGR through 2030.</p><p>
