Polyurethane foam dressing is a kind of wound dressing used to treat moderate to severe exudation wounds. These dressings are made of soft, flexible foam materials, which conform to the shape of the wound, absorb excess fluid, and maintain a moist wound environment to promote healing. Polyurethane foam dressings are available in a variety of shapes and sizes for a range of wound types, including pressure ulcers, leg ulcers, surgical wounds, and trauma. They are usually fixed with secondary dressings, such as tape or adhesive bandages. One of the main advantages of polyurethane foam dressings is the ability to absorb large amounts of fluid, which helps to reduce the risk of impregnation (skin softening and cracking) and prevent wound infection. Foam materials also provide cushioning and protection for wounds, helping to reduce pain and promote healing. The polyurethane foam dressing is usually replaced every 1-3 days, depending on the amount of exudate produced by the wound. They are generally safe and well tolerated by most patients, but may not be suitable for wounds with little or no exudate.</p><p>
