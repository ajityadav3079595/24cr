</p><p>Kerosene fuel is a light petroleum distillate commonly used in aviation (jet fuel), heating, and lighting applications. This refined hydrocarbon product falls between gasoline and diesel in terms of boiling range and molecular weight. The primary variants include <strong>Jet A, Jet A1 (the global standard for commercial aviation), JP-5 (military specification), and JP-8 (military fuel compatible with civilian engines)</strong>. While traditional uses dominate current demand, emerging bio-kerosene alternatives are gaining traction in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) initiatives.</p><p>
</p><p>Market growth stems from rebounding air travel demand post-pandemic, particularly in Asia-Pacific where China's domestic aviation kerosene consumption alone reached 38 million metric tons in 2023. However, environmental regulations like CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) are accelerating the shift toward low-carbon alternatives. Recent developments include Shell's December 2023 announcement to supply SAF blended with conventional jet fuel to Singapore Changi Airport, reflecting industry efforts to meet 10% sustainable fuel targets by 2030.
