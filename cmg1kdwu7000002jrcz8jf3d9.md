# Prestressed Concrete Strand (PC Strand) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Prestressed Concrete Strand (PC Strand) is a high-strength steel cable composed of multiple steel wires, typically 2, 3, 7, or more, designed for use in prestressed concrete structures. This material undergoes stress-relief processing, making it ideal for applications that demand high tensile strength and durability. PC Strand is widely used in large-scale infrastructure projects, including railway and highway bridges, overpasses, LNG storage tanks, multi-story industrial buildings, sports stadiums, and nuclear reactors.</p><p>
