# Superabsorbing Polymers (SAP) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Superabsorbing Polymers (SAPs) are highly absorbent materials that can retain large amounts of liquid relative to their mass. These polymers are primarily used in applications requiring high water retention, such as hygiene products (diapers, adult incontinence products, and sanitary napkins), agriculture, medical wound dressings, and industrial applications. The ability of SAPs to absorb and retain fluids makes them crucial in sectors where moisture control and retention are essential.</p><p>
