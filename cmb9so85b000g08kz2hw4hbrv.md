# Ethylenediaminedi Acid Global Market Insights 2024, Analysis and Forecast to 2029, by Manufacturers, Regions, Technology, Application

<p><strong>This report describes the global market size of Ethylenediaminedi Acid from 2019 to 2023 and its CAGR from 2019 to 2023, and also forecasts its market size to the end of 2029 and its CAGR from 2024 to 2029.</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Ethylenediaminediacetic acid (EDDA) is an organic compound with the chemical formula C2H4(NHCH2CO2H)2. It is a white solid and a derivative of two molecules of glycine, in which the amine groups are linked. The conjugate base of EDDA is a tetradentate ligand, meaning it can form coordination complexes with metal ions by binding to them at four different sites.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
