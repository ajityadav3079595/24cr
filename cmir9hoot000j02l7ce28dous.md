<strong>MARKET CHALLENGES</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Technical Limitations in Viewing Angle Performance</strong></p><p>
</p><p>While prism sheets excel at improving on-axis brightness, they typically reduce viewing angle performance compared to alternative optical solutions. This trade-off creates engineering challenges for applications where wide viewing angles are prioritized, such as public information displays and certain automotive applications. Manufacturers are investing heavily in hybrid optical designs that balance brightness enhancement with acceptable viewing characteristics.</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Intense Competition from Alternative Technologies</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The prism sheet market faces growing competition from emerging light management solutions including quantum dot films, micro-lens arrays, and advanced diffuser technologies. Some display manufacturers are exploring these alternatives as they seek to optimize optical performance while simplifying backlight architectures. Maintaining technological leadership through continuous innovation will be critical for prism sheet suppliers to defend their market position.</p><p>
</p><p>Additionally, the display industry's transition to self-emissive technologies like OLED and microLED poses a long-term challenge for backlight component suppliers. While prism sheets remain essential for LCD-based displays, their role in next-generation display architectures is less certain, requiring proactive adaptation by market participants.</p><p>
