</p><p>Factors such as industrial expansion in Asia-Pacific and increasing demand for precision chemicals in manufacturing sectors are fueling this market. China, India, and Southeast Asian countries have witnessed a surge in demand, reflecting in both volume and value. In contrast, developed regions like Europe and North America are focusing on the refinement of ammonium thiocyanate for analytical and specialty chemical uses, slightly elevating the price trends in those areas.</p><p>
</p><p>Ammonium thiocyanate, with the chemical formula NH4SCN, is a colorless, crystalline inorganic compound widely used across various industrial applications. Its most notable properties include high solubility in water, methanol, ethanol, and acetone, with poor solubility in chloroform and ethyl acetate. This deliquescent compound is primarily valued for its utility in the synthesis of herbicides, pesticides, and thiourea. A unique characteristic of ammonium thiocyanate is its interaction with iron salts—its aqueous solution turns blood red upon contact with iron salt solutions, showcasing its utility in analytical chemistry. It exhibits a melting point around 149°C and a transformation into thiourea upon heating to 170°C.</p><p>
</p><p>Ammonium thiocyanate is also employed in textile dyeing, electroplating, and photography. Additionally, it's used in chemical analysis as a reagent and finds roles in oil field applications. Its ability to act as a precursor to other thiocyanates and complex compounds makes it an important chemical across diversified industries.</p><p>
