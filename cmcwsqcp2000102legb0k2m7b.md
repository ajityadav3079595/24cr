The application of cutting fluid in the field of engineering manufacturing has a history of hundreds of years, and it plays a vital role in the processing efficiency and surface quality of parts. Among them, water-based cutting fluid accounts for more than 90% of the consumption of cutting fluid. Water-based cutting fluid is made by mixing mineral oil or synthetic oil with water in a certain proportion. It is a coolant and lubricant widely used in processing. Adding various additives to the cutting fluid is often necessary to enhance the performance of the cutting fluid and prolong its service life.Water-based cutting fluids are divided into emulsion type, semisynthetic type and synthetic type. Emulsified cutting fluid is an oil-in-water emulsion obtained by mixing base oil (mineral oil) with water containing emulsifiers. The content of mineral oil is greater than 60%, showing milky white. Synthetic cutting fluid takes inorganic salt and organic amine as the main body and adds various additives such as preservatives or defoamers to dissolve in water to form a transparent or slightly colored aqueous solution. Semisynthetic cutting fluid is a combination of oil-in-water emulsion and synthetic fluid, which has the characteristics of emulsified cutting fluid and synthetic cutting fluid.Compared with oil-based cutting fluids, water-based cutting fluids use additives such as lubricants, rust inhibitors, and antioxidants, which makes the water-based cutting fluid not only maintain the lubrication and antirust performance of the oil-based cutting fluid but also have a stronger heat dissipation capacity. Among water-based cutting fluids, semisynthetic cutting fluids have gradually become the best choice in the metal processing industry due to their excellent comprehensive performance.</p><p>
