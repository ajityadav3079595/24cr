</p><p>The existing waste management systems in most countries are not optimized for <strong>biodegradable polymers,</strong> creating confusion in disposal streams. Unlike traditional recycling processes designed for PET or HDPE, PABT requires specific composting conditions (temperature, humidity, microbial activity) for complete degradation. With fewer than 15% of municipalities worldwide offering industrial composting facilities, much of PABT's environmental benefit is unrealized as products often end up in landfills where degradation conditions are suboptimal. This infrastructure gap discourages brands from adopting PABT despite its technical merits.</p><p>
<strong>MARKET OPPORTUNITIES</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Emerging Applications in Medical Devices Present New Growth Frontiers</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The medical industry's shift toward single-use, biodegradable devices creates promising opportunities for PABT.
