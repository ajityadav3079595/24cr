# Hard Carbon Material Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030

<p><strong>The global hard carbon material market was valued at US$ 4,400 million in 2024 The market is projected to reach US$ 6,375 million by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 5.4% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Hard carbon is a solid form of carbon that cannot be converted to graphite by heat-treatment, even at temperatures as high as 3000°C. It is also known as char, or non-graphitizing carbon. More colloquially it can be described as charcoal. Hard carbon is produced by heating carbonaceous precursors to approximately 1000°C in the absence of oxygen. Among the precursors for hard carbon are polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC), lignin and sucrose. Other precursors, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and petroleum coke, produce soft carbon, or graphitizing carbon. Soft carbon can be readily converted to graphite by heating to 3000°C.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
