</p><p>Historically, the market for PBS has been relatively niche but is gaining momentum as more industries focus on sustainability. As governments and organizations implement more stringent regulations on non-biodegradable plastic use, the demand for biodegradable alternatives like PBS is expected to increase.</p><p>
Market Size</p><p>
Polybutylene Succinate (PBS) is an environmentally friendly and biodegradable polymer material made from the combination of 1,4-succinic acid and 1,4-butanediol. It falls under the category of aliphatic polyester and is widely regarded for its low environmental impact due to its ability to degrade under natural conditions. PBS's molecular structure consists of repeating units of butylene succinate, giving it its unique properties. The polymer is primarily used in various applications such as packaging, medical materials, and agricultural products due to its biodegradable nature.</p><p>
</p><p>PBS can be synthesized both chemically, from petrochemical sources, and biologically, through microbial fermentation, which is considered more sustainable. This polymer exhibits excellent mechanical properties such as tensile strength, flexibility, and impact resistance, making it a favorable alternative to conventional plastics. It is also recognized for being non-toxic and is safe for use in various medical and consumer products.</p><p>
