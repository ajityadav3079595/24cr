# Super Engineering Plastics Market Size, Share Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030

<p><strong>The global Super Engineering Plastics market was valued at US$ 13910 million in 2023 and is projected to reach US$ 18690 million by 2030, at a CAGR of 4.3% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Plastics basically fall into two categories: thermosetting resin and thermoplastic resin. Thermoplastic resin is further classified into general purpose plastics and engineering plastics. Engineering plastics are classified as thermoplastic resin that can withstand heat of over 100?C. Even more heat-resistant thermoplastic resins able to be used for a long period in heat of over 150?C are called “super engineering plastics.”</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
