</p><p><strong>Solar Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA) Film is a critical encapsulant material used in the manufacture of photovoltaic (PV) modules. It serves two primary roles: securely bonding the solar cells with the front glass and rear backsheet layers, and shielding the solar cells from environmental stressors such as moisture, dust, and UV radiation. The material's durability, transparency, and adhesive properties make it indispensable for ensuring long-term performance and reliability of solar panels. EVA films are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, ease of processing, and thermal stability, becoming the industry standard in the encapsulation process of crystalline silicon-based solar modules.</strong></p><p>
