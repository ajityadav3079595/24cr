# Sintered Permanent Magnetic Material Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Global Sintered Permanent Magnetic Material Market Analysis</p><p>
</p><p>Sintered NdFeB (Neodymium Iron Boron) magnets are permanent magnetic materials based on a tetragonal crystal structure composed of neodymium, iron, and boron. These magnets are produced using a powder metallurgy process, where fine powders of the raw materials are mixed, compressed, and then sintered (heated without melting) to form solid magnets. Developed in the early 1980s by M. Sagawa and his team, sintered NdFeB magnets revolutionized the field of permanent magnets due to their high magnetic strength and versatility.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
