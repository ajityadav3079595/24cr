# Plasma Protein Powder Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Plasma Protein Powder is a highly digestible protein derived from animal blood plasma. It is commonly used in animal nutrition, particularly in animal feed and pet food products. This protein powder is created through a spray-drying process, preserving bio-active components and offering a natural alternative to traditional antibiotics and zinc oxide in feed formulations. Plasma protein powder is widely known for improving feed palatability, enhancing gut health, and boosting immune systems in animals. This makes it particularly valuable in livestock, poultry, and aquaculture industries, where animal health and feed efficiency are of utmost importance.</p><p>
