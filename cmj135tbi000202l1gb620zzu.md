The top producers include R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons, Avery Dennison, Zebra, Sato, and Coveris.</p><p>
</p><p>Liner Less Paper refers to a category of pressure-sensitive labels that do not contain a release liner or backing paper. Instead, these labels are coated with a special release coating on the facestock, which allows them to be wound on rolls without sticking to each other. This release coating facilitates label dispensing while ensuring that the adhesive does not adhere to the label beneath it. Linerless labels offer multiple benefits such as reduced waste, enhanced sustainability, and cost-effectiveness. Facestocks can include materials like standard paper, films, and direct thermal paper, while the adhesives used can be permanent, removable, or repositionable, making them adaptable for a wide range of applications.</p><p>
</p><p>These labels are widely used across various industries including food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, logistics, and retail due to their efficiency and environmental benefits. Unlike traditional labels, which generate waste due to the liner, linerless labels contribute to greener packaging solutions and are gaining popularity in line with global sustainability goals.</p><p>
