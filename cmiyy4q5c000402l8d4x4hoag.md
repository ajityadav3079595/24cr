# PPLP (Polypropylene Laminated Paper) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Polypropylene Laminated Paper (PPLP) is a specialized composite material consisting of paper laminated with a polypropylene layer. This combination enhances the paper's durability, moisture resistance, and strength, making it ideal for applications in packaging, insulation, and electrical industries. PPLP was first developed by SUMITOMO Electric in 1970 and has since evolved to become a critical material in high-voltage electrical insulation and industrial packaging.</p><p>
