North America alone accounted for <strong>USD 10,211.88 million in 2023 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.57% between 2025 and 2032.</strong></p><p>
</p><p>High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) is a sweetener derived from corn starch, composed of varying proportions of fructose and glucose. It is widely used in food and beverage products to enhance sweetness, increase shelf life, and improve texture. HFCS is typically produced through enzymatic processing of corn starch, converting some of the glucose into fructose. The resulting product contains a higher percentage of fructose than regular corn syrup, which enhances its sweetness.</p><p>
</p><p>HFCS is commonly available in two primary forms, HFCS 42 and HFCS 55, where the numbers refer to the percentage of fructose in the syrup. HFCS 42 contains 42% fructose, and HFCS 55 contains 55% fructose, with the remainder being glucose. The syrup is widely used in products like soft drinks, processed foods, baked goods, and condiments.</p><p>
</p><p>HFCS is sometimes used interchangeably with table sugar (sucrose) due to its similar sweetness profile, but it is less expensive to produce. The use of HFCS has been a subject of debate due to health concerns associated with excessive consumption, as studies have linked high intake of HFCS to obesity, metabolic disorders, and diabetes.</p><p>
