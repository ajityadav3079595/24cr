# Medical Grade Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Medical Grade Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) is a water-soluble synthetic polymer widely used in the pharmaceutical and medical industries due to its biocompatibility, non-toxicity, and excellent film-forming properties. PVA is particularly valued in medical applications such as tablet coatings, eye drops, topicals, and biofermentation. The polymer’s superior oxygen permeability, emulsifying capabilities, and non-immunogenic nature make it a key excipient in pharmaceutical formulations.</p><p>
