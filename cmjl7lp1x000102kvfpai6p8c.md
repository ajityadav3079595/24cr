The coal bar extruder is a coal bar forming equipment that uses the principle of spiral extrusion to compress the prepared pulverized coal into a predetermined shape with a certain strength. The rotating impeller sandwiches the raw coal from the feeding port and pushes the coal forward. The raw coal is gradually compressed, the particles are close together, and at the same time, there is relatively large agitation and mixing. At this time, there is strong friction and shear between the raw coal particles, between the particles and the blade and the cylinder. At the same time, under the effect of heat generation, the temperature of the raw coal rises, the moisture and binder become more uniform, and the plasticity of the coal is also greatly increased. After the control of the mold cone, the coal particles are compressed more closely, and then pressed into the straight part of the mold, and the coal rod machine is formed.</p><p>
