# Sodium Cyanide Solution Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>
</p><p>The Sodium Cyanide Solution market encompasses the production, distribution, and application of sodium cyanide dissolved in water, primarily used in gold and silver mining to extract precious metals from ores. This highly toxic solution is a strong base and reacts violently with acids. Its compatibility with oxidants and susceptibility to carbon dioxide in the air, which can release hydrogen cyanide gas, makes its handling and use highly regulated.</p><p>
