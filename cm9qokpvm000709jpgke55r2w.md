# Cationic Clay Stabilizer Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Cationic clay stabilizers are chemical additives used in the oil and gas industry, primarily in drilling and hydraulic fracturing operations. These stabilizers are designed to prevent clay swelling and migration, which can impede the extraction process and damage critical equipment. In the context of hydraulic fracturing and drilling, they help maintain the stability and integrity of the drilling fluid, ensuring smoother operations and improving the efficiency of oil and gas extraction. Their key applications include active water, perforating fluid, fracturing fluid, drilling fluid, and acidizing solutions.</p><p>
