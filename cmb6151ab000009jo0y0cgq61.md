# Reverse Osmosis (RO) Membrane Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Reverse osmosis (RO) is a water purification technology that utilizes a semipermeable membrane to remove dissolved salts, organic molecules, and impurities from water. This process is widely used in desalination, industrial water treatment, and commercial applications to produce clean and purified water. RO membranes play a crucial role in this filtration process by allowing water molecules to pass through while blocking contaminants.</p><p>
