</p><p>Pentyl acetate, also known as amyl acetate, is an organic compound with the chemical formula C7H14O2. It is a colorless liquid with a banana-like odor and is used as a solvent for paints, lacquers, and liquid bandages, as well as a flavorant in some applications. Pentyl acetate is the esterification product of acetic acid and 1-pentanol, although other isomers of amyl alcohol can also be used to produce it. It is only slightly soluble in water, but is very soluble in most organic solvents. Pentyl acetate can be toxic if ingested and may cause irritation to the skin, eyes, and respiratory system, so proper safety precautions should be taken when handling it.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
