Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer Composites (CFRP) are lightweight, strong materials used in the manufacturing of numerous products used in our daily life. In general, CFRP composites use thermosetting resins such as epoxy, polyester, or vinyl ester.</p><p>
Pressure vessel composite materials are used in manufacturing pressure vessels that are used to store gases and liquids under high pressure. The strength of the vessel is the critical parameter to prevent explosions as a result of the rupture. A composite material is a combination of materials differing in composition or form on a macro scale. These materials do not dissolve or otherwise merge completely into each other. Composite materials help to improve the performance and also offers a significant amount of material savings.</p><p>
Since 1970 pressure vessel manufacturers have been using continuous fibers filaments, also known as tows or roving, to improve the physical properties of pressure vessels. Starting with what the industry calls a type II vessel; high strength fibers, such as glass fiber, were wrapped around the cylindrical sections of steel and aluminum pressure vessels to add reinforcement allowing a roughly 30% reduction in overall vessel mass.</p><p>
As the fiber reinforcement became more and more significant in pressure vessel design, fiber manufacturers began refining their offerings and experimenting with new fiber types like carbon fiber, which is currently the most popular reinforcement in composite pressure vessels, because of its incredible stiffness and tensile strength. In addition to carbon and glass, new fibers were created such as Kevlar a type of aramid fiber and basalt fiber. These new fibers offered contrasting mechanical properties such as impact resistance, and low temperature resistance to the pressure vessel designer’s arsenal.</p><p>
As new composite pressure vessel applications emerged, the need for unique mechanical properties and increasing economic pressures create a need for hybrid vessels which could either use distinct and separate layers of fiber for different roles such as impact/ abrasion resistance, or different fibers in the same band to get the properties of both fibers throughout the laminate.</p><p>
The evolution of vessels and tanks designed to hold liquids and gases under pressure has proceeded through four distinct stages: all-metal tanks (Type I), metal hoop-wrapped composite tanks (Type II), metal-lined composite tanks (Type III) and plastic-lined composite tanks (Type IV). The fifth stage, an all-composite, linerless Type V tank has been the pressure vessel industry’s Holy Grail for years.</p><p>
