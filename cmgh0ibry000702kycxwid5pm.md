# Polyvinyl Alcohol for Textile Sizing Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) is widely used as a sizing agent in the textile industry, particularly for synthetic fibers and their blends. Its water solubility and strong adhesive properties make it a preferred choice for improving yarn strength, reducing hairiness, and enhancing weaving efficiency. However, PVA does not degrade easily, contributing significantly to pollution in textile effluent treatment plants.</p><p>
