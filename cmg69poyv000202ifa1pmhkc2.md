</p><p>Nylon (PA) 6 &amp; 66 are both synthetic polymers called polyamides, with the numbers describing the type and quantity of polymer chains in their chemical structure. Most nylons, including 6 &amp; 66, are semi-crystalline and possess good strength and durability for demanding applications. Nylon 6 should be used if a lightweight engineering plastic is required to withstand high impact and stress. It has better aesthetic appearance than Nylon 66 due to its lustrous finish and is easier to dye. It is an ideal choice for applications in the automotive, industrial and military industries. Common applications include: gears, firearm components and automotive engine compartments. It is not ideal, however, for applications that are exposed to water at high temperatures due to its higher water absorption and lower heat deflection rate than Nylon 66, which would be a better choice.</p><p>
