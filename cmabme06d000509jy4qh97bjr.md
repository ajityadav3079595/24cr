# Hot Briquetted Iron (HBI) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>The Hot Briquetted Iron (HBI) market refers to a premium form of Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) that has been compacted at a temperature exceeding 650°C during compaction and has a density higher than 5,000 kilograms per cubic meter (5,000 kg/m3). HBI was developed to address the challenges associated with the transportation and handling of DRI. It is less porous and reactive than DRI, eliminating the risk of self-heating typically linked with DRI.</p><p>
