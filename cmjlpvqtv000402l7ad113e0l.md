The market has witnessed consistent expansion over the past decade, driven by clinical evidence supporting the role of lutein in preventing age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts.</p><p>
</p><p>Moreover, expanding applications in nutraceuticals, functional foods, and cosmetics are further enhancing market demand. The rise in plant-based diets and the global shift towards preventive healthcare have bolstered the demand for naturally derived bioactive compounds like lutein.</p><p>
</p><p>Lutein and Lutein Esters are naturally occurring carotenoids that play a vital role in maintaining eye health, among other physiological benefits. Lutein, a xanthophyll, is primarily synthesized by green leafy vegetables like spinach and kale and is abundantly found in yellow carrots and corn. It functions as an antioxidant and light-filtering pigment that protects the eyes from damage caused by blue light and oxidative stress. Lutein Esters are the esterified form of lutein, usually found in marigold flowers, which are the primary commercial source of this nutrient. These esters are hydrolyzed in the human body to release free lutein, thereby delivering similar health benefits. Lutein and Lutein Esters are widely incorporated into dietary supplements, fortified foods, animal feed, and cosmetics, owing to their high bioavailability and functional benefits.</p><p>
