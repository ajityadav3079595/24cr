# Global Paraquat Dichloride Market Research Report 2025-2032

<p>The global paraquat dichloride market was valued at <strong>US$ 367 million</strong> in 2024 and is projected to reach <strong>US$ 530 million</strong> by 2032, exhibiting a <strong>Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 4.7%</strong> during the forecast period (2025–2032). The market growth is driven by increasing demand for herbicides in agricultural applications, particularly in developing regions. The rising need for high-efficiency weed control solutions in cash crops and vegetables is a significant factor contributing to market expansion. Additionally, the adoption of paraquat dichloride in non-agricultural applications, such as industrial weed control, is expected to further boost market growth.</p><p>
</p><p>Paraquat dichloride is a <strong>non-selective herbicide</strong> widely used for controlling weeds in agricultural and non-agricultural settings. It is a fast-acting chemical that disrupts photosynthesis, leading to rapid plant death. The primary product forms include <strong>Paraquat Dichloride 24% SL</strong> and other formulations. The herbicide is particularly effective in managing weeds in crops such as fruits, vegetables, and cash crops. Due to its high efficacy, paraquat dichloride is a preferred choice for farmers seeking cost-effective weed management solutions. However, its use is regulated in several countries due to its toxicity, requiring strict handling and application guidelines.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
