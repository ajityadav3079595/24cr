This reflects a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 6.40% over the forecast period.</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The market’s robust growth can be attributed to the rising adoption of liquorice extract in functional foods, over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, and organic cosmetics.

With rising consumer interest in preventive healthcare and wellness products, this figure is anticipated to rise significantly through 2032.</p><p>
</p><p> Liquorice extract is a concentrated derivative obtained from the roots of the Glycyrrhiza glabra plant, widely known for its distinctive sweet flavor and therapeutic benefits. Historically rooted in traditional oriental medicine, liquorice extract has been used for centuries to treat various ailments such as digestive issues, respiratory conditions, and inflammatory disorders. The extract is rich in glycyrrhizin, a compound known for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties.</p><p>
</p><p>Today, liquorice extract is extensively used across several industries, including food and beverages, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and tobacco. In the food industry, it serves as a flavoring agent, particularly in confectionery and beverages. In pharmaceuticals, it is incorporated into formulations aimed at treating sore throat, stomach ulcers, and liver disorders. Cosmetic applications include skin brightening and anti-aging products, owing to its soothing and healing properties. Its use in tobacco products primarily relates to flavor enhancement.</p><p>
</p><p>The liquorice extract market comprises various product forms such as powder, liquid, and block extracts, catering to diverse industrial needs. The demand is further driven by the global shift towards natural and plant-based ingredients in consumer goods.</p><p>
