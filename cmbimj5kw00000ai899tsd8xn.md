</p><p><strong>East Engineered Quartz Stone (EQS) is made from either a natural slab that has been polished or engineered quartz composite. Quartz is one of the hardest natural materials on earth and has an appearance similar to granite. Pure, natural quartz slabs are very expensive and are therefore quite uncommon as countertops. The engineered type is made of 93 to 97 percent ground quartz combined with resins, binders, and pigments. This type of counter is much more affordable and common than the natural slab.</strong></p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
