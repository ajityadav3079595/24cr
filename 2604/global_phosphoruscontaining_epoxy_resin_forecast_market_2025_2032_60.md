</p><p><strong>Phosphorus-containing epoxy resins are a specialized class of flame-retardant polymers created by integrating phosphorus-based compounds into the epoxy matrix. Epoxy resins, widely utilized in high-performance composites, adhesives, coatings, and electronics, are naturally flammable. To counteract this, researchers and manufacturers incorporate flame-retardant additives. Among these, phosphorus-based additives stand out due to their superior thermal stability, low toxicity, reduced smoke production, and environmentally friendly properties compared to halogenated alternatives. These additives work by promoting char formation and inhibiting the release of flammable gases during combustion.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Phosphorus-containing epoxy resins can be formulated using either organic or inorganic phosphorus compounds. Organic phosphorus-based flame retardants are integrated directly into the resin's molecular structure, enhancing compatibility and performance. In contrast, inorganic variants typically act as additive fillers. Applications span across electronics, automotive, aerospace, and construction, where safety and material integrity under fire exposure are critical.</strong></p><p>
