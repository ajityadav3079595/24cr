The packaging substrate is the largest part of the packaging material cost, and it mainly plays the role of carrying and protecting the chip and connecting the upper chip and the lower circuit board. The packaging substrate can protect, fix, and support the chip, enhance the heat conduction and heat dissipation performance of the chip, and also connect the chip and the printed circuit board to realize electrical and physical connections, power distribution, signal distribution, and communication between the internal and external circuits of the chip. Packaging substrates can usually be divided into three types of substrates: organic, inorganic and composite.The organic substrate has a low dielectric constant and is easy to process, which is suitable for high-frequency signal transmission with low thermal conductivity requirements; the non-polar substrate is supported by inorganic ceramics, which has good heat resistance, easy wiring and dimensional stability, but there are certain limitations in cost and material toxicity ; Composite substrates are based on the characteristics of different requirements to compound different organic and inorganic materials. In the future, organic and composite substrates are expected to be mainstream substrate materials...</p><p>
