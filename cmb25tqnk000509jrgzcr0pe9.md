# Low Density Plumber Tape Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Low-density plumber tape, often referred to as Teflon tape or PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene) tape, is a type of thread-sealing tape used in plumbing applications to seal pipe threads and prevent leakage. It is made of a high-quality, flexible, and chemically resistant material that is particularly effective at sealing threaded connections, especially in water and gas systems. The tape is wound around the threads of pipes or fittings before they are tightened, providing a tight seal that helps prevent leaks and ensures system integrity.
