# Feed Polygalactosidase Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Feed Polygalactosidase is a specialized enzyme used in animal nutrition to enhance digestion and nutrient absorption. It primarily works by breaking down galactosidic linkages in plant-based feed ingredients, improving the bioavailability of essential nutrients. This enzyme is widely used in the poultry, swine, and ruminant industries to optimize feed efficiency and reduce feed costs.</p><p>
