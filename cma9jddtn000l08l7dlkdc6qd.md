</p><p>Growth in this sector is primarily driven by increased demand from automotive manufacturers looking for lightweight materials to meet regulatory fuel economy standards and reduce emissions. The Asia-Pacific region is also witnessing significant growth, fueled by urbanization, infrastructure development, and an expanding automotive base in countries like China and India.</p><p>
</p><p>Glass Mat Thermoplastic Composite (GMT) is a high-performance material made by combining glass fibers with a thermoplastic matrix. The process involves layering chopped or continuous glass mats into thermoplastic resin to produce sheets that are then formed into complex shapes using heat and pressure. GMT composites are known for their high strength-to-weight ratio, recyclability, impact resistance, and durability. These features make them ideal for a variety of structural and semi-structural applications in industries such as automotive, aerospace, marine, and construction. One of the most significant advantages of GMT composites is their ability to reduce vehicle weight without compromising strength, which helps improve fuel efficiency and performance.</p><p>
