Mannan-Oligosaccharide (MOS) is an indigestible short-chain polymer derived from the partial hydrolysis of mannans, which are found in the cell walls of certain fungi, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. MOS is widely used as a prebiotic supplement in animal feed to improve gastrointestinal health and promote the growth of beneficial microorganisms. Additionally, MOS has been shown to have immunomodulatory and anticancer properties, making it a promising ingredient in functional foods. The enzymatic synthesis of MOS from various mannans is a growing field of research, as it offers a more environmentally friendly and efficient method of production compared to chemical hydrolysis. Overall, MOS is an important component of many animal feeds and has the potential to be used in a variety of health-promoting applications.</p><p>
