# Polyoxymethylene (POM) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Polyoxymethylene (POM), also known as acetal, polyacetal, and polyformaldehyde, is a high-performance engineering thermoplastic. It is primarily used in precision parts requiring high stiffness, low friction, and excellent dimensional stability. POM is widely utilized in the automotive, electrical, consumer goods, and industrial sectors due to its superior mechanical properties, chemical resistance, and durability.</p><p>
</p><p>POM is available in two main types: homopolymer and copolymer. Homopolymer POM has higher crystallinity, offering better mechanical strength, while copolymer POM provides enhanced thermal stability and chemical resistance. Both types are extensively used in applications like gears, bearings, fasteners, and fuel system components.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
