</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Pediatric HIV Prevention Protocols Elevating Demand</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The critical use of zidovudine in <strong>preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission</strong> (PMTCT) represents a key growth segment. Current WHO guidelines recommend zidovudine-containing regimens for all HIV-positive pregnant women, creating consistent demand across antenatal care systems. In high-prevalence regions, optimized PMTCT protocols have achieved transmission reduction rates exceeding <strong>95%</strong>, demonstrating both clinical efficacy and sustained market potential for this application.</p><p>
<strong>MARKET RESTRAINTS</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Patent Expirations and Generic Competition Squeezing Profit Margins</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The zidovudine market faces significant pricing pressure following the <strong>expiration of key patents</strong> across major markets. With multiple generic manufacturers entering the space, average selling prices have declined approximately <strong>8-10% annually</strong> since 2020. While this increases accessibility, it creates challenging economics for originator companies and reduces R&amp;D incentives for next-generation formulations. The proliferation of local manufacturers in Asia and Africa has particularly intensified competition in price-sensitive markets.</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Side Effect Profile Limiting First-Line Use in Developed Markets</strong></p><p>
</p><p>While zidovudine retains importance in resource-limited settings, its market position in high-income countries is constrained by <strong>adverse effect concerns</strong>. Hematological toxicities and mitochondrial dysfunction associated with long-term use have prompted treatment guidelines in North America and Europe to favor newer ARVs with improved safety profiles. Clinical data shows zidovudine prescriptions in these regions have decreased by <strong>22%</strong> since 2018 as providers adopt alternative regimens despite higher costs.</p><p>
<strong>MARKET CHALLENGES</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Supply Chain Vulnerabilities Threatening Medication Access</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The zidovudine market contends with significant <strong>supply chain fragility</strong>, particularly in markets dependent on imports. API manufacturing remains concentrated in a few geographic locations, creating vulnerability to disruptions like those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic.
