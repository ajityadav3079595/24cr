# Global Alcohol-based Ink Binder Market Research Report 2025-2032

<p>The global alcohol-based ink binder market was valued at <strong>US$ 752 million in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>US$ 1.17 billion by 2032</strong>, exhibiting a <strong>Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 5.7%</strong> during the forecast period (2025–2032). The market growth is driven by increasing demand for high-performance printing solutions in packaging, textiles, and industrial applications. The adoption of alcohol-based ink binders is rising due to their superior adhesion, quick drying properties, and compatibility with various substrates.</p><p>
</p><p>Alcohol-based ink binders are chemical compounds used to improve the adhesion of ink to surfaces, ensuring durability and resistance to environmental factors. These binders are primarily composed of polyurethane, acrylic, and other synthetic resins, which enhance the ink's performance in printing applications. They are widely used in <strong>surface printing</strong> and <strong>inside printing</strong> processes, offering excellent color retention and fast drying times. The versatility of alcohol-based ink binders makes them essential in industries such as packaging, automotive, and textiles.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
