Anti-sagging tungsten wire doped with K (potassium) or other elements to achieve the effect of non-sagging tungsten wire. With the use of K stimulants, the foam of the tungsten wire can be formed, which can prevent the recrystallization of the tungsten wire. Anti-sag tungsten wires are mainly used as filaments for incandescent lamps, fluorescent lamps and other bulbs and as heating wires for electronic tubes. Applicable to non-sagging tungsten materials, enabling anti-sag tungsten wire, tungsten wire strand properties. They can vibrate less when the light source or heating element is doped material for non-sagging tungsten filaments in use. Anti-sag tungsten filaments for automotive and motorcycle lights, is one of the most important applications. When anti-sag tungsten wire is used in the filament of this bulb, the wire can be used for cars and motorcycles to function most efficiently, achieving stable light from the lamp. Incandescent applications have the same effect.</p><p>
