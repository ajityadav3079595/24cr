# Flavin adenine dinucleotide (CAS 146-14-5) Market, Global Outlook & Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD) is a redox coenzyme found in all living cells. It is essential for several biochemical reactions in both plants and animals, particularly in cellular respiration and metabolic processes. FAD is involved in important biological functions, such as mitochondrial electron transport, where it facilitates the transfer of electrons during oxidative phosphorylation, helping to generate cellular energy (ATP). As both an oxidized and reduced form, FAD serves a critical role in cellular metabolism and energy production.</p><p>
</p><p>Due to its essential role in numerous biochemical processes, FAD finds applications across various sectors, including pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, food &amp; beverages, and cosmetics. Its presence in these industries, particularly in the form of a bioactive ingredient in supplements and functional foods, as well as its role in drug formulation and enzymatic therapies, positions FAD as an integral component in these sectors.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
