# Printing Blanket Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>A printing blanket is an essential component of offset printing, acting as the intermediary between the printing plate and the substrate. It is a composite product consisting of a rubber coating bonded to a substrate, which can range from paper and textiles to aluminum sheets and plastic. The primary function of a printing blanket is to transfer ink from the lithographic plate to the printing surface, ensuring high-quality print reproduction. Initially made of pure rubber, advancements in material science have led to the incorporation of synthetic rubbers such as Buna N, Neoprene, NVR (nitrile butadiene rubber), and EPDM (ethylene propylene diene rubber), improving durability, flexibility, and performance. Reinforcement with fabric or metal backing enhances the strength of the blanket, making it more resistant to wear and tear in high-speed printing applications.</p><p>
