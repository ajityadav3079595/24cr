North America alone accounted for <strong>USD 2,041.37 million in 2023</strong>, reflecting a strong regional demand and is expected to grow at a <strong>3.00% CAGR</strong> through 2030. Rapid industrialization, rising demand for high-performance materials, and stringent environmental regulations are key contributors to this marketâ€™s expansion.</p><p>
</p><p>Polymer stabilizers are critical additives used in the polymer manufacturing process to enhance the durability, stability, and performance of polymer-based materials. These stabilizers mitigate the adverse effects caused by environmental stressors such as heat, oxygen, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and ozone. Polymers, by nature, are prone to degradation due to oxidation, chain scission, cross-linking, and other reactions that compromise their mechanical and visual properties. Polymer stabilizers serve as protective agents, extending the lifespan and preserving the functionality of polymers used in various industrial applications. Their functionality encompasses several categories such as antioxidants, UV stabilizers, heat stabilizers, and anti-ozonants.</p><p>
