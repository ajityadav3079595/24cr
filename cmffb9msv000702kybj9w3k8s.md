# Residue Hydrodemetalization Catalysts Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Residue Hydrodemetalization (RHDM) catalysts are specialized catalysts used in the refining industry to remove metal impurities such as nickel, vanadium, and iron from crude oil residues. These residues are the heavy, viscous by-products obtained during the distillation of crude oil. Crude oil residues, due to their high metal content, can cause significant damage to refining equipment, as well as degrade the quality of the final products. To address this issue, RHDM catalysts are deployed in refining processes to selectively eliminate metals while preserving valuable hydrocarbons, thus improving both the efficiency and safety of the refining operation.</p><p>
</p><p>These catalysts facilitate a chemical process known as hydrodemetalization, which involves the application of hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst to break down metal compounds and remove them from the crude oil residues. This process plays a vital role in improving the longevity of refining equipment, reducing operational costs, and ensuring the quality of the refined products.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
