</p><p>. This significant growth rate is driven by increasing adoption of biodegradable polymers in medical, agricultural, and packaging industries. The historical growth has been fueled by advancements in polymer technology and a growing emphasis on sustainability. The demand surge is particularly noticeable in North America and Asia-Pacific due to their well-developed medical sectors and increasing environmental regulations.</p><p>
</p><p>Polyglycolide Acid (PGA), also known as polyglycolic acid or polyglycolide, is a biodegradable, thermoplastic polymer derived from glycolic acid. Characterized by its high crystallinity and fast degradation profile, PGA is commonly used in medical applications, especially in the production of bioresorbable sutures. Due to its biocompatibility and environmentally friendly degradation into glycolic acid, PGA has expanded its application in packaging, agriculture, and industrial sectors. It is synthesized through polycondensation or ring-opening polymerization and offers remarkable mechanical strength, making it a preferred material in high-performance, short-lifecycle products.</p><p>
