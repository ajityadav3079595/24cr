<strong>MARKET CHALLENGES</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Competition From Alternative Customs Schemes to Impact Growth Momentum</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Regional customs unions and bilateral transit agreements provide competing documentation options that often carry lower administrative burdens. The European Union's TIR system, covering over 70 countries, processes nearly 5 million transit operations annually - creating formidable competition for international transit document providers.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Other Challenges</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Fraud Prevention</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Document security remains an ongoing challenge, with counterfeit cases accounting for approximately 3-5% of processed Carnets annually. Providers must continually invest in security features while balancing ease-of-use requirements.</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Third-Party Dependencies</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Local Chamber of Commerce participation remains inconsistent across markets, with 25% of potential issuing locations lacking authorized certifying bodies. This creates service gaps that hinder market expansion into secondary cities and rural regions.</p><p>
<strong>MARKET OPPORTUNITIES</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Integration With Emerging Trade Corridors to Unlock Growth Potential</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The development of new international transport routes presents significant opportunities.
