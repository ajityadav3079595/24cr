<strong>MARKET CHALLENGES</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Competition from Alternative Waterproofing Methods</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Membrane manufacturers are fighting back with improved products, including self-adhering sheets that install 60% faster than traditional systems. Some developers still perceive surface-applied membranes as more visually verifiable than integral admixtures, despite their shorter lifespans. The roofing sector remains particularly resistant to change, with over 85% of commercial roofs still using membrane systems. Convincing specifiers to shift paradigms requires extensive education about admixture performance verification methods and long-term cost benefits.</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Regulatory Complexities in Chemical Approvals</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Varying national chemical regulations create market entry barriers, particularly for novel formulations.
