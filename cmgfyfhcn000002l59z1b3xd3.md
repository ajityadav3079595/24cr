<strong>MARKET DRIVERS</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Rising Demand for Renewable Energy to Accelerate PKS Adoption</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The global shift toward renewable energy sources is a primary driver for the biomass fuel (PKS) market. With countries targeting net-zero emissions, biomass fuels like PKS are gaining traction as carbon-neutral alternatives to fossil fuels. The European Union's Renewable Energy Directive III mandates 42.5% renewable energy in the energy mix by 2030, creating substantial demand for sustainable biomass fuels. Japan's Feed-in-Tariff system for biomass power generation, offering 24 JPY/kWh for certified PKS, further stimulates this demand. Given that PKS has a high calorific value of approximately 4,500 kcal/kg - comparable to low-rank coal - while being biodegradable, its adoption in co-firing power plants continues to rise.</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Sustainable Waste Management in Palm Oil Industry Boosts Commercial Value</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The palm oil industry generates over 80 million metric tons of PKS annually as byproduct, primarily in Indonesia and Malaysia. Previously considered waste, PKS now represents an additional revenue stream for palm oil mills through biomass fuel commercialization. This circular economy approach not only reduces waste disposal costs but also aligns with ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) goals. Indonesia's Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources reported a 62% increase in PKS utilization for power generation between 2019-2023, demonstrating how waste-to-energy conversion is transforming industry economics while meeting sustainability targets.</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Asian Energy Policies Create Structural Demand for PKS</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Japan's strategic energy policy has positioned PKS as a key biomass feedstock, accounting for 38% of its biomass imports in 2023. The country's geographical proximity to Southeast Asian producers and established shipping routes enable cost-efficient PKS procurement. South Korea's Renewable Portfolio Standard also mandates power providers to source 25% of electricity from renewables by 2026, with biomass playing a pivotal role. Such policy frameworks create sustained, long-term demand for PKS as utilities seek reliable, compliant biomass sources to meet regulatory obligations while maintaining operational efficiency.</p><p>

</p><p><strong>â¤ The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) now requires Sustainable Palm Oil Certification for all imported PKS, accelerating certified product adoption from 33% to projected 46% market share by 2027.</strong></p><p>
<strong>MARKET RESTRAINTS</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Supply Chain Fragmentation and Quality Inconsistency Challenges</strong></p><p>
</p><p>While PKS production is abundant, the market faces significant supply chain challenges. The raw material's decentralized nature across thousands of palm oil mills in Indonesia and Malaysia leads to inconsistent quality and fragmented supply. Moisture content variations (ranging 15-25%), contamination risks, and lack of standardized processing create hurdles for international buyers requiring uniform fuel specifications. This fragmentation forces importers to establish localized procurement networks, increasing operational complexity and costs. Without integrated supply chain solutions, market scalability remains constrained despite ample raw material availability.</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Certification Costs and Compliance Burdens</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The shift toward certified sustainable PKS introduces cost barriers that may slow market penetration. ISCC or RSB certification processes add 8-12% to production costs, which smaller operators struggle to absorb.

This bifurcation creates market inefficiencies where certified product premiums reach 15-20% over conventional PKS, potentially limiting demand growth in developing economies where cost remains the primary purchasing criterion.</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Infrastructure Limitations in Producing Regions</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Basic infrastructure gaps in major PKS-producing areas present persistent challenges. Many palm oil mills lack dedicated drying facilities, leading to inconsistent fuel moisture levels that affect combustion efficiency. Port congestion and limited bulk handling equipment at Indonesian export terminals frequently cause shipment delays. These logistical bottlenecks become acute during peak harvest seasons when raw material volumes surge. Without significant infrastructure investment, supply chain disruptions will continue restraining the market's ability to reliably serve global demand, particularly as Japanese and European utilities require just-in-time deliveries for power plant operations.</p><p>
<strong>MARKET CHALLENGES</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Competition from Alternative Biomass Feedstocks</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The PKS market faces intensifying competition from other biomass fuels like wood pellets and agricultural residues. Wood pellet production has scaled rapidly to 36 million tons globally in 2023, benefiting from established supply chains and standardized specifications. While PKS offers cost advantages in Southeast Asia, transportation economics render it less competitive in trans-Atlantic trade flows where wood pellets dominate. Emerging torrefacted biomass products also threaten PKS's market position by offering higher energy density and improved handling characteristics. Maintaining competitiveness requires continuous improvement in PKS processing and quality standardization to justify its value proposition against evolving alternatives.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Other Challenges</strong></p><p>
