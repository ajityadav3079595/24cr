# Drop Forging Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p><strong>The global drop forging market was valued at approximately USD 214 million in 2023. It is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.50%, reaching around USD 318.02 million by 2032. The North American market, estimated at USD 60.15 million in 2023, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 3.86% from 2024 through 2032. This growth is driven by increasing demand in the automotive, aerospace, and industrial sectors.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Drop forging is a metal shaping process in which a hot piece of metal is hammered between the stationary and moving parts of a two-piece hollow metal die. This process deforms the metal into a desired shape in one or several operations. There are two primary types of drop forging: open-die drop forging and closed-die drop forging. Open-die forging does not fully enclose the workpiece, while closed-die forging does. This technique is widely used in manufacturing axles, crankshafts, gears, and tools.</strong></p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
