<strong>MARKET CHALLENGES</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Workforce Shortages Constraining Production Capacity</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The specialized nature of aviation glass manufacturing requires highly skilled technicians, with 35% of the current workforce nearing retirement age. Training new employees takes 18-24 months, creating production bottlenecks as demand grows. Manufacturers report vacancy rates exceeding 15% for critical positions, forcing increased automation investments that require $2-3 million per production line.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Other Challenges</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Price Volatility in Key Materials</strong>
Aerospace-grade polycarbonate prices have fluctuated by 45% since 2020 due to petrochemical market instability. These input cost variations make long-term contracting difficult, with manufacturers absorbing 60-70% of price increases due to fixed-price agreements with OEMs.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Technology Disruption Risks</strong>
Emerging materials like graphene-enhanced composites and self-healing polymers could potentially disrupt traditional glass markets. While still in development, these technologies could capture 15-20% of the aviation glazing market by 2035, requiring existing players to significantly increase R&amp;D spending to maintain competitiveness.</p><p>
