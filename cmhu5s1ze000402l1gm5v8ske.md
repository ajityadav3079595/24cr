</p><p>D-Allulose is a rare sugar and epimer of fructose that offers approximately 70% of the sweetness of sucrose with minimal caloric content. This functional sweetener has gained significant traction due to its unique properties, including low glycemic response, high solubility, and ability to participate in Maillard reactions. Unlike artificial sweeteners, D-Allulose occurs naturally in small quantities in wheat, figs, and raisins, making it appealing to health-conscious consumers seeking clean-label ingredients.</p><p>
</p><p>The market growth is primarily driven by increasing global health concerns, particularly the rising prevalence of diabetes and obesity. With over 37% of the global population classified as obese according to WHO data and diabetes cases projected to reach epidemic levels by 2030, demand for low-calorie sweeteners continues to surge. Food and beverage manufacturers are increasingly formulating products with D-Allulose as sugar replacement, especially in applications requiring bulk sweetness without the metabolic impact of traditional sugars. Regulatory approvals in key markets, including FDA's GRAS designation, have further accelerated market adoption.</p><p>
