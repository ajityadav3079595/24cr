Due to the small particle size of nano-silica, it has the characteristics of large specific surface area, good surface adsorption, high dispersion, and excessive chemical purity. Nanosilica, also known as silica dust or quartz dust, is characterized by silica powder. It shows 99% silica. The application of nanosilica helps reduce the amount of cement required to create solid structures. Industrial production of silica nanoparticles and sales of commercial products are increasing. Most of them are divided into two main forms: P type and S type. The former has a nanopore diameter of 0.61 ml/g, while the latter has a relatively small surface area. Type P is known to exhibit a higher range of UV rays. Nanoscale silica is produced through a silane condensation process that results in the formation of an amorphous network of oxygen and silicon. Due to their low cost, diverse surface functionality, and high specific surface area, they are widely used in protein separation and adsorption processes.</p><p>
