# Hydrogenated Rosin Ester Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2031

<p>
</p><p>The global Hydrogeniodide market was valued at <strong>$70.2 million in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>$93.5 million by 2031</strong>, growing at a <strong>CAGR of 4.3%</strong> during the forecast period. This market growth is driven by the increasing utilization of hydrogen iodide (HI) across various industries, particularly pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and electronics. Hydrogen iodide, available as both a liquefied gas and as an aqueous solution (hydriodic acid), serves essential roles in industrial synthesis, analytical chemistry, and as a potent reducing agent.</p><p>
Hydrogen iodide (HI) is a colorless gas or aqueous solution widely used in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. It serves as a key precursor and reducing agent in organic synthesis and is instrumental in the manufacturing of disinfectants and certain pharmaceuticals. Hydriodic acid, the aqueous solution of HI, is recognized for its strong acidity and efficacy in analytical applications.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
