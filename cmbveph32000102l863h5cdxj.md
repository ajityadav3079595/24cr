# InCl3 used for InMe3 Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Indium trichloride (InCI3) is a white, odorless, highly soluble powder that is used to prepare other inorganic and organic indium compounds. The most widely used precursor, TMI (trimethylindium), is produced from indium trichloride and utilized in the production of indium-containing composite metal compounds. The process involves dissolving indium trichloride in a dry organic solvent and reacting it with a methylating reagent, such as methylmagnesium bromide, to obtain trimethylindium and magnesium chloride as by-products.</p><p>
