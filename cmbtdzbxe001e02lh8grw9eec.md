</p><p>Hydrogenated Bisphenol A (HBPA) is a saturated diol produced by catalytic reduction of Bisphenol A. While similar in structure to Bishphenol A, it undergoes most of the reactions typical of secondary alcohols. It is available as a white, flaked material which is soluble in a wide range of organic solvents.</p><p>
</p><p>
HBPA is used in the preparation of alkyd, polyester, and epoxy resins where good color stability and improved weatherability are important for lasting quality. Areas of application include casting, laminating, coatings, and fiber production.</p><p>
