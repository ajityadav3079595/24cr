</p><p>Historical data from 2019 to 2023 show steady growth, driven by rising demand from the personal care and cosmetics industry. The market has seen increased usage of eco-friendly glitter in makeup, nail art, and festive decorations. With increasing regulatory pressure against microplastics and heightened environmental consciousness among consumers, the biodegradable glitter market is poised for accelerated expansion. Additionally, product innovation aimed at enhancing sparkle, texture, and durability is expected to further boost market value over the next few years.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Biodegradable Glitter</strong> refers to an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional plastic-based glitter. Made primarily from plant-derived cellulose, often sourced from eucalyptus trees, biodegradable glitter decomposes naturally in the environment, minimizing pollution and harm to ecosystems. Unlike conventional microplastics, biodegradable glitter breaks down in natural settings such as freshwater, marine environments, and soil, making it a sustainable choice for decorative applications. The market includes a wide range of glitter types used in cosmetics, arts and crafts, fashion, and packaging. In South Korea, this eco-conscious product is rapidly gaining popularity, aligning with the country’s stringent environmental policies and rising consumer awareness around sustainability.</p><p>
