Chinese consumers are increasingly drawn to "clean beauty" products, fueling demand for baobab oil in skincare formulations due to its moisturizing and antioxidant properties. Government support for the natural products sector and established distribution networks contribute to the country's leading position. High levels of urbanization and growing disposable incomes further amplify the adoption of premium natural personal care products containing baobab oil. The market is also witnessing increased investment in sustainable sourcing initiatives, aligning with consumer demand for ethically produced goods.
