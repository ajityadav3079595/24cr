</p><p>PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) conduits are tubing systems used primarily for electrical wiring protection in residential, commercial, and industrial settings. These conduits offer excellent insulation, corrosion resistance, and durability, making them a preferred choice for electrical installations over traditional metallic conduits.</p><p>
</p><p>PVC conduits are widely used in underground and exposed wiring applications due to their lightweight properties, ease of installation, and resistance to moisture, chemicals, and environmental factors. They are categorized into rigid and flexible types, catering to different wiring and cabling needs in various sectors such as construction, manufacturing, and telecommunications.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The market's expansion is primarily fueled by increasing construction activities, growing investments in smart city projects, and rising demand for underground electrical networks.</p><p>
