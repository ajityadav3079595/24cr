In 2023, North America accounted for approximately<strong> USD 4.78 million of the global market and is expected to experience a CAGR of 10.54% during the forecast period.</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The market's expansion is fueled by an increasing number of companies committing to sustainable supply chains and the growing popularity of third-party certifications like the Global Recycled Standard (GRS), which assures end-to-end traceability and environmental responsibility. The robust growth in demand is anticipated to continue as consumers, corporations, and governments align with global sustainability goals.</p><p>
</p><p>Global Recycled Standard (GRS) Certified Recycled Plastic refers to plastic materials that are certified by the Global Recycled Standard, a voluntary product standard for tracking and verifying the content of recycled materials in a final product. The GRS also includes social and environmental practices and chemical restrictions. The certification ensures that the plastics used have been sourced, processed, and distributed in a sustainable and traceable manner, minimizing environmental impact and improving supply chain transparency.</p><p>
</p><p>GRS Certified Recycled Plastics include a wide range of polymers, such as Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE), Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), and others, which are reclaimed and processed to meet rigorous environmental and social criteria. These materials are increasingly being used in packaging, textiles, electronics, automotive parts, and more.</p><p>
