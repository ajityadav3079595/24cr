# High Purity Pyrolytic Graphite Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Pyrolytic Graphite (PG) is a specialized form of graphite produced by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of hydrocarbon gases at extremely high temperatures in a vacuum furnace. This process results in an ultra-pure, highly anisotropic material with near-theoretical density. High Purity Pyrolytic Graphite is widely used in applications requiring excellent thermal and electrical conductivity, chemical resistance, and mechanical strength.</p><p>
