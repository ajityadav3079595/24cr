# Benzoyl Chloride Price Trend, Spot Prices, Historical and Forecast Price Movement Charts, 2025 Edition

<p>The global pricing landscape for benzoyl chloride is influenced by raw material costs, supply-demand dynamics, regional production capacities, and geopolitical events. China and India dominate the market in the Asia-Pacific region; prices from early 2025 stand at 8,100 Yuan per metric ton (~$1,200/ton). Stabilized regional prices have flattened after a bumpy 2024, with oversupply driving reduced feedstock benzene prices, although other demand areas have stabilized for agrochemicals, dyes, and pharmaceutical demand. The domestic market in India is largely tied to import pricing, which is overwhelmingly from China. Domestic production will slowly grow and fill gaps going forward. In North America, prices had gone as high as approximately $1,530 per metric ton in Q1 2024 but declined in Q2 because of oversupply and weaker demand for agrochemicals. This was further coupled with downward pressure to domestic prices, which resulted from imports from Asia.
European pricing trends shows the higher cost of production in the region, caused by stricter environmental constraints, as well as energy prices. Prices jumped early in 2024 due to robust demand but fell with oversupply and easing benzene costs. The Middle East and Africa import from Asia and Europe but have local premium pricing in line with general global trends but reflecting local logistics cost premium. Similarly, South America, especially Brazil and Argentina, is an import-dependent region, and the prices are highly sensitive to the cost of products imported from North America and Asia-Pacific. 
Region-wise, raw material costs, especially benzene, are a significant factor in determining benzoyl chloride prices, followed by regulatory pressures, currency exchange rates, and geopolitical events. Despite ongoing demand from sectors like agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals, oversupply in China and Europe has resulted in a pessimistic pricing picture.
The pricing of Benzoyl Chloride in 2025 is influenced by a variety of economic, industrial, and environmental factors. Key elements shaping the market include:
1. Feedstock Cost: The main feedstock for the synthesis of benzoyl chloride is benzene, which is obtained from natural gas and crude oil. Any change in the price of crude oil brought on by OPEC decisions, geopolitical events, or adjustments to energy policy affects the price of benzene, which in turn affects the price of benzoyl chloride. For example, rising prices for crude oil raise the cost of benzene, which in turn raises the cost of producing benzoyl chloride. On the other hand, a decrease in the price of crude oil usually lowers the cost of benzene, which drives down the price of benzoyl chloride.
2. Global Demand Supply Dynamics: The balance between global supply and demand plays a critical role. An oversupply, particularly in China (the largest producer), can saturate the market, driving prices down. However, strong demand from industries such as agrochemicals (herbicides, pesticides), pharmaceuticals (active ingredients), and plastics (intermediates for specialty chemicals) may increase prices if supply cannot keep pace. For example, during the planting season, heightened demand for agrochemicals could spike benzoyl chloride prices temporarily.
3. Environmental Regulations: More stringent environmental regulations in Europe and North America have led to an increase in the cost of production. Regulations tend to require high technologies for controlling emissions and sophisticated systems for ensuring compliance, raising operational costs. Benzoyl chloride is a dangerous chemical; it is both toxic and corrosive. Thus, producing it requires proper care. This will increase the price of benzoyl chloride in the domestic market.
4. Global Trade and Geo-Political Factors: Benzoyl chloride availability in some areas may be restricted by trade disruptions such as tariffs, sanctions, or export limitations. For example, importing nations may encounter supply shortages, which could result in price increases, if China imposes trade restrictions or limits exports. In a similar vein, the price of benzoyl chloride can be indirectly impacted by the cost of feedstock benzene due to geopolitical concerns in oil-producing regions.
5. Economy Trend and End Use Industry: Demand from the end-user industry is determined by the economic health of key markets. The demand for agrochemicals is driven by a healthy agricultural sector, while the demand for benzoyl chloride as an intermediate increases in a healthy pharmaceutical market. In contrast, a slowdown or recession can reduce industrial activity, and subsequently, weakens demand, leading to price declines. An example would be the slowdown of construction activities lowering the demand for specialty chemicals, indirectly impacting benzoyl chloride prices.
The demand for benzoyl chloride is high due to its wide application in various industries. It is a crucial intermediate in chemical manufacturing. In the agrochemical industry, it is used in the production of herbicides, pesticides, and plant growth regulators, which are vital for increasing agricultural productivity. In the pharmaceutical industry, benzoyl chloride is used in the synthesis of APIs, such as benzoyl peroxide, an active ingredient in products used for the treatment of acne. In the dye and pigment industry, it is used to synthesize benzoyl derivatives that are necessary for the preparation of bright and stable colorants. Benzoyl chloride is also used in the polymer and plastics industry for the production of specialty polymers and resins that are used in coatings, adhesives, and sealants. Its use in the production of perfumery chemicals also adds to the demand as it is a precursor to aromatic compounds in fragrances. With these different applications, demand for benzoyl chloride will remain strong due to growth in agriculture, healthcare, and industrial manufacturing.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
