# Sodium Trimetaphosphate (STMP) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Sodium Trimetaphosphate (STMP) is a white, crystalline, inorganic compound widely used in various industrial applications, particularly in the food, pharmaceutical, and water treatment industries. It serves as a key ingredient in food additives, stabilizers, and dispersing agents, enhancing the texture and shelf life of processed foods. In water treatment, it acts as a sequestrant, helping to prevent scale formation. Additionally, STMP is employed in ceramics, detergents, and textile processing, where it improves product efficiency and performance.</p><p>
