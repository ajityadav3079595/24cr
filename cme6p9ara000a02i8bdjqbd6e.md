# Poly(methylhydrosiloxane) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Poly(methylhydrosiloxane) (PMHS) is a type of silicone polymer that contains reactive Si-H bonds. It is widely used in industries such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, coatings, and textiles due to its hydrophobic and cross-linking properties. PMHS serves as a key ingredient in hydrosilylation reactions, functioning as a reducing agent, waterproofing agent, and crosslinker in a variety of applications. Its widespread usage is driven by its ability to modify surface properties and enhance material performance in industrial and consumer products.</p><p>
