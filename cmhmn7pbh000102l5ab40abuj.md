            https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/219960/pi-films-for-electronic-substrates-market</a></b></div><br><p>Global PI Films for Electronic Substrates market size was valued at USD 1.56 billion in 2024. The market is projected to grow from USD 1.72 billion in 2025 to USD 3.24 billion by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 8.2% during the forecast period.</p><p>
</p><p>Polyimide (PI) films are high-performance polymer materials that serve as critical components in electronic substrates due to their exceptional thermal stability, mechanical strength, and electrical insulation properties. These films are primarily used in flexible printed circuits (FPCs) and chip-on-film (COF) applications, where they act as insulating base layers that protect delicate electronic components while enabling miniaturization and flexibility in modern devices.</p><p>
</p><p>The market growth is driven by surging demand for flexible electronics across consumer electronics, automotive, and aerospace industries. The proliferation of 5G technology and foldable smartphones has particularly accelerated adoption. However, supply chain disruptions and fluctuating raw material costs present ongoing challenges. Key manufacturers like DuPont and UBE Corporation are expanding production capacities to meet demand, with Asia-Pacific dominating both consumption and manufacturing due to its concentrated electronics production ecosystem.</p><p>
