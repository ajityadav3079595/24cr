</p><p>While lightweight concrete blocks excel in partition walls and low-rise construction, their reduced compressive strength creates technical limitations for taller structures. The typical compressive strength ranges from <strong>3.5 to 7 MPa</strong>, compared to <strong>10-15 MPa</strong> for dense concrete blocks, preventing their use in load-bearing applications above 3-4 stories. This constraint forces architects to specify hybrid structural systems in mid-rise buildings, adding complexity to designs and potentially negating some of the material's weight advantages.</p><p>
</p><p>The industry continues to invest in R&amp;D to enhance structural performance without compromising density benefits. Recent advancements in fiber reinforcement and nanotechnology additives show promise, but widespread adoption of these enhanced products remains limited by technical hurdles and production scaling challenges.</p><p>
<strong>MARKET OPPORTUNITIES</strong></p><p>
