</p><p>Fire retardant paints for wood are specialized coatings designed to slow the spread of flames and reduce the flammability of wooden structures. These paints are critical in enhancing fire safety in buildings by delaying the combustion process, thereby providing additional time for evacuation and emergency response. The formulations typically include fire-resistant chemicals such as ammonium phosphate, borax, or other intumescent materials that expand when exposed to heat, forming a protective char layer.</p><p>
</p><p>These paints are widely used in both interior and exterior applications, including timber frames, cladding, and structural components. They are available in two primary types: <strong>water-based</strong> and <strong>solvent-based</strong>, each offering distinct advantages in terms of environmental impact, drying time, and durability. The growing emphasis on sustainable construction has also led to the development of eco-friendly fire retardant paints, further broadening their adoption across various industries.</p><p>
