</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Semiconductor Epoxy Molding Compound (EMC)</strong> is a thermosetting resin-based material used primarily in semiconductor packaging. It provides critical encapsulation and protection for semiconductor chips and wire bonds against environmental factors such as moisture, dust, and mechanical stress. EMC is commonly applied using a <strong>transfer molding</strong> process, which ensures high precision and reliability in forming protective layers around electronic components.</p><p>
