</p><p>Intermediate Bulk Container (IBC) liners are removable liners designed to package and transport liquid, powdery, and semi-solid materials. These liners are typically utilized in Intermediate Bulk Containers (IBCs) for added protection and convenience. IBC liners are commonly made of plastic and offer durability, corrosion resistance, leak-proof properties, and ease of cleaning. They play a crucial role in preventing material contact with the container's inner surface, thereby mitigating issues like contamination, cross-contamination, and clogging. Additionally, IBC liners provide an extra layer of protection against spills and simplify waste disposal processes.</p><p>
