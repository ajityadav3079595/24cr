</p><p>High purity Copper (II) oxide, also known as cupric oxide (CuO), is a refined and high-grade form of copper oxide specifically engineered for advanced electronic applications. It plays a crucial role as a raw material in electroplating, especially within the insoluble anodic acid copper plating process used for manufacturing high-end circuit boards. These circuit boards are essential components in a variety of consumer electronics such as mobile phones, laptops, automotive electronics, data storage systems, and telecommunications devices.</p><p>
</p><p>Unlike standard-grade copper oxide, high purity variants are meticulously processed to remove impurities that could compromise the performance and reliability of microelectronic devices. Its usage spans multiple subfields within electronics manufacturing, including semiconductor packaging, IC (integrated circuit) carrier boards, HDI (high-density interconnect) boards, FPC (flexible printed circuit) boards, and SLP (substrate-like PCBs).</p><p>
