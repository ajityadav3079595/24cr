The main resources for potassium sulphate are found in combination with other mineral sulfates, such as magnesium, sodium and calcium. Another way of producing potassium sulphate is a combination of potassium chloride and kieserite. Most common forms of manufacture are from potassium chloride through a synthetic reaction with sulfuric acid or sulfur dioxide.</p><p>
</p><p>
Sulfate of Potash contains between 50-52% of K2O and approx. 18% of sulphur which is a needed element in plant growth and deficient in many soils. In the commercial market, combining potassium (50% K2O) and sulphur (18%) potassium sulfate is the majority commercial product due to the high concentration of nutrients readily available to plants. Otherwise than potassium chloride (SOP) does not contain any chlorides, which can be harmful to some crops like tobacco, fruits and vegetable.</p><p>
