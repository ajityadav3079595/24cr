</p><p>The region’s growth is attributed to advancements in controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) and the rising focus on sustainable farming practices.This growth is driven by the increasing adoption of advanced farming techniques, rising demand for high-yield crops, and expanding greenhouse farming across various regions.</p><p>
</p><p>
<strong>Market Size</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Agriculture polyolefin (PO) film is an advanced greenhouse covering material made from high-grade olefin raw materials combined with other additives. This film enhances crop productivity by offering superior light transmission, UV stability, and temperature control. Compared to traditional polyethylene films, PO films provide improved mechanical strength, durability, and anti-fogging properties, making them a preferred choice for modern agricultural applications.</p><p>
