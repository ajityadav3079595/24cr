# Global Oxo Alcohol Market Research Report 2025-2032

<p>The global oxo alcohol market was valued at <strong>US$ 17.8 billion in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>US$ 26.4 billion by 2032</strong>, exhibiting a <strong>Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 5.1%</strong> during the forecast period (2025–2032). The market is driven by increasing demand from end-use industries such as plasticizer, adhesive, and lubricant manufacturing. Growth is further supported by rising industrialization and urbanization in emerging economies.</p><p>
</p><p>Oxo alcohols are a group of alcohols produced through the oxo process, which involves the hydroformylation of olefins followed by hydrogenation. These alcohols are widely used as intermediates in the production of plasticizers, solvents, and adhesives. Key products in the oxo alcohol market include <strong>2-methyl-2-butanol (2M2B), n-butanol, 2-ethylhexanol, and isononyl alcohol</strong>. These compounds are essential in various industrial applications due to their chemical properties, such as high solvency and low volatility.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
