</p><p>Ferrous sulfate is an inorganic compound primarily produced as a byproduct of titanium dioxide manufacturing. It exists in three major forms: ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, monohydrate, and tetrahydrate. The heptahydrate form, a green crystalline substance, dominates production volumes because it's directly obtained from titanium processing. While it's water-soluble and acidic, its commercial value stems from diverse industrial applications rather than its inherent chemical properties.</p><p>
</p><p>The market growth is driven by expanding applications in iron oxide pigments (which account for approximately 30% of consumption) and emerging opportunities in battery manufacturing. Ferrous sulfate serves as a precursor for iron phosphate, a key component in lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. However, environmental concerns around byproduct disposal continue challenging titanium dioxide producers, pushing them toward commercializing ferrous sulfate rather than treating it as waste. The Asia-Pacific region leads both production and consumption, with China's growing battery industry particularly influencing demand dynamics.</p><p>
