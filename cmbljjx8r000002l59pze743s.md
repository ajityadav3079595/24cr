# POM?Polyoxymethylene? Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>POM (Polyoxymethylene), commonly known as acetal homopolymer and polyacetal, is an engineering thermoplastic with superior mechanical properties. It is widely used in high-load mechanical applications and high-precision parts such as gears, bearings, medical devices, and automotive components. POM is known for its excellent dimensional stability, low friction, and high wear resistance. It is available in two major categories: POM Homopolymer (POM-H) and POM Copolymer (POM-C), each with distinct characteristics that make them suitable for different applications.</p><p>
