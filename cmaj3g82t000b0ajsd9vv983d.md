# Electrolytic Chromium Coated Steel (ECCS) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2030

<p>Electrolytic Chromium Coated Steel (ECCS), also known as tin-free steel, is a type of low-carbon cold-rolled steel coated with a thin layer of metallic chromium and a layer of chromium oxide. This coating enhances corrosion resistance, provides an excellent surface finish, and offers superior adhesion for paints and lacquers. ECCS is extensively used in the packaging industry, especially for manufacturing beverage cans, food containers, bottle caps, and closures. Its properties of strength, durability, and formability make it an essential material in various industrial applications.</p><p>
