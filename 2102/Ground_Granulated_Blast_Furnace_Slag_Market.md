 <p>Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag is a kind of glass-like granular material produced by blast furnace slag after fine grinding and water quenching. It is mainly composed of silicate, calcium oxide, alumina and other compounds, and has the characteristics of high strength, high toughness, alkali resistance, and aging resistance.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>GBFS is an ideal cement admixture, which can replace part of cement to improve the durability, strength and crack resistance of concrete. Compared with traditional cement, GBFS blended cement can reduce the heat release, alkalinity, shrinkage and other adverse effects of concrete, and can also reduce CO2 emissions. In addition, GBFS can also be used to manufacture roadbed fillers, railway pads and other materials in infrastructure construction such as roadbeds and railway tracks.</p>
