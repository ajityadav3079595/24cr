# Mulch Plastic Film Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>The mulch plastic film market refers to the use of plastic films in agriculture and horticulture to cover soil. This practice helps in warming the soil, conserving moisture, and preventing the growth of weeds. Additionally, mulch plastic films offer a protective barrier against soil pathogens, enhancing crop quality and yield. These films are typically applied in fields, orchards, and greenhouses to provide optimal growing conditions. The films come in various types, including low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and biodegradable options like polylactic acid (PLA) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA).</p><p>
