</p><p>Textile oil, often referred to as spinning oil or lubricating oil, is a critical specialty lubricant used extensively in the textile manufacturing sector. Its primary function is to reduce friction and wear during the processing of fibers, yarns, and fabrics. This oil plays an essential role in minimizing static electricity, ensuring smooth machine operations, and enhancing the quality and efficiency of textile production. Typically used in processes such as spinning, weaving, knitting, and sewing, textile oils are formulated to meet specific lubrication requirements while being non-reactive with fabrics. The product’s compatibility with various textile materials, its biodegradable nature (in some cases), and its contribution to prolonging machinery life make it indispensable in modern textile industries.</p><p>
