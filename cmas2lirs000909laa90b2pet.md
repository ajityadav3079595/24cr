# Global Ground Granulated Blast-Furnace Slag (GGBFS) Market Research Report 2025-2032

<p>
</p><p>Ground Granulated Blast-Furnace Slag (GGBFS) is a by-product of the iron and steel manufacturing industry, formed by quenching molten iron slag in water or steam. This process creates a glassy, granular product, which is subsequently dried and finely ground into powder. GGBFS is predominantly used as a cementitious material due to its high content of calcium silicate hydrate (CSH), a compound that enhances the strength, durability, and appearance of concrete. The material is crucial for improving the properties of concrete by enhancing its resistance to sulfate attack and reducing permeability. GGBFS is widely utilized in construction applications, contributing to more sustainable building practices by reducing the overall environmental impact of concrete production.</p><p>
