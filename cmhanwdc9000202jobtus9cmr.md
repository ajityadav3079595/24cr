<p><strong>"Raney Nickel Catalyst Market" was valued at US$ 1,274 Million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 1,753 Million by 2030, at a CAGR of 5.5% during the forecast period.</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Raney Nickel is a solid catalyst composed of fine grains of a nickel-aluminium alloy, used in many industrial processes. It was developed in 1926 by American engineer Murray Raney as an alternative catalyst for the hydrogenation of vegetable oils in industrial processes. More recently it is used as a heterogeneous catalyst in a variety of organic syntheses, most commonly for hydrogenation reactions.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

</p><p>A variety of grades is known, but most are gray solids. Some are pyrophoric; most are used as air-stable slurries. Raney Nickel is produced when a block of nickel-aluminium alloy is treated with concentrated sodium hydroxide. This treatment, called "activation", dissolves most of the aluminium out of the alloy. The porous structure left behind has a large surface area, which gives high catalytic activity. A typical catalyst is around 85-percent nickel by mass, corresponding to about two atoms of nickel for every atom of aluminium.</p><p>

</p><p>Raney nickel catalysts are a class of solid heterogeneous catalysts used extensively in the chemical industry, particularly in hydrogenation reactions. They are composed of a fine powder of nickel and aluminum alloy, from which aluminum is leached to create a high surface area, porous structure. This structure makes Raney nickel highly effective in facilitating hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and other catalytic processes.</p><p>
