The burgeoning solar PV industry and the miniaturization trend in electronics are the principal contributors to this upward trajectory. Moreover, initiatives aimed at reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to cleaner energy sources further bolster the adoption of HPQ in renewable energy systems.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>High Purity Silica</strong>, also known as High Purity Quartz (HPQ), refers to quartz products that contain SiO2 levels of 99.99% and above with extremely low impurity levels, particularly Fe2O3 content below 0.001%. This material plays a critical role in high-tech industries, including the production of semiconductors, solar photovoltaic (PV) cells, high-intensity lighting, optical fibers, and LCD panels. Due to its superior purity, high thermal resistance, and excellent chemical inertness, HPQ is indispensable for applications where performance and quality standards are extremely stringent. One of the most recognized high purity silica products in the global market is the IOTA® high purity quartz sands, developed by Sibelco.</p><p>
