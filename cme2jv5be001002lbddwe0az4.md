# Renewable Naphtha Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Renewable naphtha is a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional naphtha, derived from renewable sources like fats and oils. It is a crucial co-product in the production of renewable diesel. As a 100% hydrocarbon renewable gasoline blendstock, it is used primarily in biofuels and green plastics. Its major advantage over petroleum-based naphtha is its ability to significantly reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions, making it an essential part of the growing renewable energy sector. Renewable naphtha can be produced in two distinct types: light and heavy, depending on its intended application and blending requirements.</p><p>
