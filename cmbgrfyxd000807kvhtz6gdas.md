</p><p><strong>Report Overview</strong></p><p>
</p><p></p><p>
</p><p>Graphene, an allotrope of carbon, is composed of hexagonal atoms fused together in a recurring design. Due to its extreme thinness, graphene is treated as two-dimensional. The honeycomb structure of graphene gives it multiple exceptional characteristics, such as being a highly strong and light material in the world. It is also a decent conductive and nearly transparent. Graphene has a number of potential applications in different industries. Graphene is oxidized to form graphene oxide, which is easy to process since it is soluble in water. Graphene oxide is not a good conductor of heat and electricity, but can be processed to enhance its properties. It is commonly available in powder or dispersed form, as well as a coating on substrates. Graphene oxide readily mixes in water, which has led to its use in water-based paints &amp; inks, thin films, and biomedical applications.</p><p>
