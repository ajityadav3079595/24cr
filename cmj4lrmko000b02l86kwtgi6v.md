</p><p><strong>As of 2024, the global Sclerotium Gum market is valued at approximately USD 8.5 million and is projected to reach USD 10.5 million by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 3.1% during the forecast period.</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Despite being a niche segment in the broader cosmetic ingredients market, the steady growth of Sclerotium gum is driven by rising consumer awareness of sustainable and natural ingredients.</p><p>
</p><p>Historically, demand for Sclerotium gum has shown resilience due to its multifunctionality and broad-spectrum compatibility. The growth trajectory is expected to continue, bolstered by the expansion of the clean beauty movement, increased R&amp;D investments in green chemistry, and regulatory encouragement for sustainable formulations.</p><p>
</p><p>Sclerotium gum is a naturally-derived polysaccharide produced through the fermentation of the filamentous fungus Sclerotium rolfsii. Chemically, it is a sugar-based molecule that belongs to the family of hydrocolloids and is known for its unique gelling, thickening, and stabilizing properties. In the cosmetic and personal care industry, Sclerotium gum is widely appreciated for its ability to enhance product texture, stability, and skin-feel without compromising the efficacy of active ingredients.</p><p>
</p><p>Used primarily in skincare formulations, it offers a silky, non-tacky finish, making it a preferred choice in high-end cosmetic products. It also performs exceptionally well in synergy with other polymers like xanthan gum and guar gum, improving the overall viscosity and feel of creams, serums, and lotions. The growing consumer demand for clean-label, plant-based ingredients further propels the relevance of Sclerotium gum in modern cosmetic formulations.</p><p>
