# Global EDTA-2NA Market Research Report 2025-2032

<p>The Global EDTA-2NA Market was valued at <strong>US$ 297 million in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>US$ 453 million by 2032</strong>, exhibiting a <strong>Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 5.4%</strong> during the forecast period (2025–2032). This growth trajectory is supported by increasing demand from key end-use industries such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and food processing. The market has demonstrated steady expansion over the past decade, driven by EDTA-2NA's versatile applications as a chelating agent. The forecasted growth is aligned with rising industrialization in emerging economies and advancements in chemical manufacturing processes. Historical data indicates a consistent upward trend, with the market growing at an average annual rate of 4.2% between 2018 and 2024. The projected acceleration in growth rate reflects both expanding applications and improved production efficiencies.</p><p>
</p><p>EDTA-2NA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt) is a water-soluble chelating agent widely used across multiple industries. This organic compound forms stable complexes with metal ions, making it invaluable for applications requiring metal ion sequestration. In the pharmaceutical industry, it serves as a stabilizer in medications and a preservative in ophthalmic solutions. The agricultural sector utilizes EDTA-2NA as a micronutrient carrier in fertilizers, while food processors employ it as a preservative to maintain product quality. The chemical's ability to bind divalent and trivalent metal cations (such as calcium and magnesium) underpins its diverse industrial applications. EDTA-2NA is manufactured in varying purity grades (0.99, 0.995, and others) to meet specific industry requirements, with each grade finding specialized use based on the intended application's technical specifications.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
