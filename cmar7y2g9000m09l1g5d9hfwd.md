</p><p>Non-coating grade titanium dioxide refers to titanium dioxide that is not used for pigmentation purposes. Unlike coating-grade titanium dioxide, which is primarily used in paints, coatings, and plastics for its opacity and brightness, non-coating grade titanium dioxide is utilized in applications where its chemical properties are more critical than its optical properties. This includes uses in enamel, welding, ceramics, electronics, and metallurgy. The product is available in two main production methods: the sulfate process and the chloride process, each offering different purity levels and particle sizes suitable for specific industrial applications.</p><p>
