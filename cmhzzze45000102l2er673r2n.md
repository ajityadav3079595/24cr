# Global Selenic Acid Market Research Report 2025-2032

<p>The global selenic acid market was valued at <strong>US$ 78 million in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>US$ 112 million by 2032</strong>, exhibiting a <strong>Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 4.6%</strong> during the forecast period (2025–2032). This growth trajectory is supported by increasing demand from key end-use industries such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and steel manufacturing. The market has demonstrated steady expansion over the past decade, driven by technological advancements and the rising adoption of selenic acid in specialized applications. The forecast period is expected to witness sustained demand, particularly in emerging economies where industrialization and pharmaceutical sector growth are accelerating.</p><p>
</p><p>Selenic acid (H2SeO4) is a strong, highly corrosive inorganic acid derived from selenium. It is primarily used in industrial and laboratory applications due to its oxidizing properties. The compound is available in various grades, including <strong>pharmaceutical grade, molecular biology grade, and reagent grade</strong>, each tailored for specific applications. Pharmaceutical-grade selenic acid is utilized in drug formulation and research, while molecular biology grade is essential for biochemical assays. Reagent-grade selenic acid finds application in chemical synthesis and analytical processes. The versatility of selenic acid makes it a critical component in multiple industries, though its handling requires stringent safety measures due to its corrosive nature.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
