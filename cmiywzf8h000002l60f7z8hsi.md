# Global Zinc EDTA Market Research Report 2025

<p>
</p><p>Zinc EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is a chelated form of zinc, widely used as a micronutrient fertilizer in agriculture. It is a stable compound that ensures zinc remains available to plants in a soluble form, preventing deficiencies that can lead to stunted growth and reduced crop yields. Zinc EDTA is particularly effective in alkaline soils where zinc is often unavailable to plants. The product is available in two primary forms: <strong>Purity ≥99%</strong> and <strong>Purity &lt;99%</strong>, each catering to specific agricultural needs. Its applications span across various crops, including grains, vegetables, fruits, and other agricultural produce, making it a versatile solution for modern farming.</p><p>
