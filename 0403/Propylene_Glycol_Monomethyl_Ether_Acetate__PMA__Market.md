<h1>Propylene Glycol Monomethyl Ether Acetate (PMA) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:16px">Propylene Glycol Monomethyl Ether Acetate (PGMEA/PMA), also known as propylene glycol methyl ether acetate, is a colorless, hygroscopic liquid with a distinctive odor. It is a versatile, non-polluting solvent characterized by multi-functional groups and the molecular formula C6H12O3. PGMEA is widely used as a solvent in industries such as printing ink, paint, textiles, and electronic cleaning agents, particularly in liquid crystal display (LCD) manufacturing. Its flammability and potential to form explosive vapor-air mixtures above 42??C necessitate careful handling and storage.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">The global PGMEA market was valued at USD 735.60 million in 2023 and is projected to grow to USD 968.00 million by 2030, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 4.00% during the forecast period. In North America, the PGMEA market reached USD 191.68 million in 2023, with an expected <strong>CAGR</strong> of 3.43% between 2025 and 2030. This steady growth can be attributed to increasing demand in coatings, inks, and electronics applications.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">The North American PGMEA market, valued at USD 191.68 million in 2023, benefits from strong industrial infrastructure and increasing adoption in the electronics and automotive sectors. The U.S. leads the region, with steady demand from semiconductor manufacturers.</span></p>
