<h1>Polyphenol Oxidase Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Polyphenol Oxidase (PPO) is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of polyphenols into quinones, leading to browning in fruits, vegetables, and other plant-based products. It plays a crucial role in food processing, agriculture, and biotechnology. In the food industry, PPO inhibitors are used to prevent undesirable browning, while in agriculture, the enzyme???s properties are harnessed for crop protection and quality enhancement.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The global Polyphenol Oxidase market was valued at USD 10.50 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 16.21 million by 2030, growing at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 6.40% during the forecast period. The North American market accounted for USD 2.74 million in 2023 and is expected to grow at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 5.49% from 2024 to 2030. The increasing application of PPO in food preservation, pharmaceuticals, and biotechnology is fueling market growth.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><strong>Growing Demand in Food Processing:</strong> The need for enzymatic browning control in fresh-cut produce, beverages, and bakery products is driving demand.</p>
