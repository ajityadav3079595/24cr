<h1>Poly-p-dioxanone Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>The global Poly-p-dioxanone (PDO) market was valued at USD 13 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 19.04 million by 2030, exhibiting a Compound Annual Growth Rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 5.60% during the forecast period.</strong></span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>The North American PDO market alone was estimated at USD 3.39 million in 2023, with a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 4.80% from 2024 to 2030.</strong> These growth trends are driven by increased adoption of biodegradable medical devices, rising surgical procedures, and advancements in suture technology.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:14px">Poly-p-dioxanone (PDO) is a biodegradable polymer obtained through the ring-opening polymerization of p-dioxanone. It is primarily used in the medical field for absorbable sutures and as a raw material in the production of innovative absorbable medical devices. Due to its biocompatibility and controlled degradation properties, PDO is a preferred choice in surgical applications.</span></p>
