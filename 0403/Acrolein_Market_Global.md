<h1>Acrolein Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:16px">Acrolein is a highly reactive, volatile liquid with a pungent odor. It is primarily used as an intermediate in the production of various chemicals, including methionine, pesticides, and glutaraldehyde. Acrolein is derived through two main production methods: the <strong>propylene oxidation method</strong> and the <strong>glycerol dehydration method</strong>. Due to its high toxicity and reactivity, acrolein requires careful handling and storage.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">The global Acrolein market was valued at <strong>USD 1,595.6 million in 2024</strong> and is expected to reach <strong>USD 1,728.4 million by 2030</strong>, growing at a <strong><strong>CAGR</strong> of 1.1%</strong> during the forecast period.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">The <strong>Europe region</strong> dominates the market with <strong>37%</strong> of the global production share.</span></p>
