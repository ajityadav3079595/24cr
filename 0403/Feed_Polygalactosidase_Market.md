<h1>Feed Polygalactosidase Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Feed Polygalactosidase is a specialized enzyme used in animal nutrition to enhance digestion and nutrient absorption. It primarily works by breaking down galactosidic linkages in plant-based feed ingredients, improving the bioavailability of essential nutrients. This enzyme is widely used in the poultry, swine, and ruminant industries to optimize feed efficiency and reduce feed costs.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The global Feed Polygalactosidase market was valued at <strong>USD 362 million in 2023</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>USD 592.80 million by 2030</strong>, growing at a <strong><strong>CAGR</strong> of 7.30%</strong> from 2024 to 2030. This growth is fueled by increasing demand for high-quality animal feed, rising concerns over feed efficiency, and advancements in enzyme technology.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Regionally, <strong>North America</strong> accounted for <strong>USD 94.33 million in 2023</strong> and is expected to grow at a <strong><strong>CAGR</strong> of 6.26%</strong> during the forecast period, driven by increasing livestock production and stringent regulations on feed additives.</p>
