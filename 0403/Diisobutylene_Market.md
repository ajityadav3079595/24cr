<h1>Diisobutylene Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:16px">Di-isobutylene (DIB) is a liquid hydrocarbon mixture consisting of two isomers: 2,4,4-trimethylpentene-1 and 2,4,4-trimethylpentene-2. This versatile chemical intermediate plays a crucial role in various industries, including rubber chemicals, lubricant additives, coatings, and fuel additives. With its unique properties, DIB is widely utilized in the production of polymerization inhibitors, plasticizers, and specialty chemicals.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">The global Diisobutylene market was valued at <strong>US$ 483.9 million in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>US$ 559.9 million by 2030</strong>, growing at a <strong><strong>CAGR</strong> of 2.1%</strong> during the forecast period. The market expansion is driven by increasing demand in the chemical industry and rising applications in rubber viscosifiers and plasticizers. Additionally, the post-pandemic recovery and geopolitical influences, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, have impacted supply chains, influencing market dynamics and pricing trends.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Growing Chemical Industry:</strong> The expansion of chemical manufacturing, especially in Asia-Pacific, fuels the demand for DIB as an essential intermediate.</span></p>
