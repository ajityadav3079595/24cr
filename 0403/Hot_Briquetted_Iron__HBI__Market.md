<h1>Hot Briquetted Iron (HBI) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:16px">The Hot Briquetted Iron (HBI) market refers to a premium form of Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) that has been compacted at a temperature exceeding 650??C during compaction and has a density higher than 5,000 kilograms per cubic meter (5,000 kg/m3). HBI was developed to address the challenges associated with the transportation and handling of DRI. It is less porous and reactive than DRI, eliminating the risk of self-heating typically linked with DRI.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">In 2023, the global Hot Briquetted Iron (HBI) market was estimated at approximately USD 4,899 million. It is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 2.30% and reach USD 6,011.57 million by 2032. The North America HBI market size was valued at USD 1,327.37 million in 2023, with a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 1.97% from 2025 to 2032.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">The market growth is driven by increasing demand for steel production, as HBI is a preferred raw material in the production process. Additionally, the environmental benefits of using HBI over traditional iron sources such as coke and coal are propelling market growth. The cost-efficiency and reduced carbon emissions associated with HBI production also contribute to its growing adoption in the steel industry.</span></p>
