</p><p>Historical analysis shows a steady upward trend in adoption, particularly in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, driven by the boom in real estate and industrial construction. Furthermore, green construction initiatives and labor shortage challenges have increased the reliance on prefabricated, modular formwork systems, further propelling market growth.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Formwork System</strong> refers to a temporary or permanent mold into which concrete or similar materials are poured during construction. The system shapes the structural elements of buildings and infrastructure until they are self-supporting. A formwork system includes several components, such as panels, braces, ties, and supports, which work together to maintain the desired shape and dimensions. These systems are crucial in ensuring the structural integrity, surface finish, and speed of construction. Modern formwork systems are evolving from traditional timber-based setups to modular systems using steel, aluminum, and plastic composites for enhanced reusability, strength, and efficiency.</p><p>
