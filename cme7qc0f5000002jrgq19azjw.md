With construction activities gaining momentum across both developed and emerging economies, the demand for high-performance expansion joints is anticipated to grow significantly.</p><p>
</p><p>The market has seen robust demand particularly in Asia-Pacific, accounting for approximately 50% of the total market share in 2024, followed by North America and Europe. The growth in the Asia-Pacific region is largely attributed to ongoing urban development, massive infrastructure projects, and rapid industrialization in countries like China and India.</p><p>
</p><p>Expansion joints in construction are structural components designed to absorb movement caused by thermal expansion, contraction, seismic activity, wind-induced motion, and other environmental or operational stresses. These joints are essentially separations or gaps integrated into buildings, bridges, highways, and other civil structures to mitigate the risk of cracks, displacements, or structural failures. They maintain the integrity and functionality of constructions by allowing relative movement between different sections of a structure.</p><p>
</p><p>The space created by an expansion joint is often filled with an expansion joint system, which includes materials and assemblies that offer waterproofing, fire resistance, sound dampening, and walkability. These systems ensure the complete enclosure and serviceability of a building or structure without compromising performance due to movement.</p><p>
