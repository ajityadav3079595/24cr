</p><p>This growth trajectory can be attributed to increasing consumer preference for natural, plant-based ingredients, rising health consciousness, and expanding applications across end-user industries.</p><p>
</p><p>The post-COVID-19 recovery and the ongoing impact of the Russia-Ukraine war have slightly altered raw material supply chains, yet the market remains resilient. Demand for menthol in hygiene, pharmaceutical, and personal care products surged during the pandemic, providing a temporary but significant market boost. As the supply chains stabilize, the market is expected to witness consistent growth driven by innovation and diversification in product usage.</p><p>
</p><p>L-Menthol is an organic compound with a characteristic minty taste and cooling effect, primarily derived from peppermint or other mint oils. It is a stereoisomer of menthol and is known for its high purity, pleasant aroma, and versatile applications across industries such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, food and beverages, and oral hygiene. Unlike D-menthol and D/L-menthol, which are either by-products or mixtures, L-menthol is the dominant form due to its superior efficacy and sensory appeal.</p><p>
</p><p>L-Menthol is used for its cooling sensation in topical formulations, analgesic products, throat lozenges, and flavoring agents. Its strong demand stems from both its functional and aromatic properties. The product also plays a critical role in treating minor aches, respiratory disorders, and as a penetration enhancer in transdermal drug delivery systems.</p><p>
