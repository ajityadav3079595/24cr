</p><p><strong>Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN)</strong> is an organic compound known for its role as a radical initiator in various polymerization processes. Structurally, AIBN is a white crystalline powder that decomposes upon heating to release nitrogen gas and generate free radicals. These radicals initiate polymerization reactions, making AIBN a vital component in the production of plastics, synthetic fibers, coatings, and adhesives. As a thermally unstable azo compound, AIBN is prized for its efficiency, reliability, and controlled decomposition behavior in free radical polymerization. It is extensively used in manufacturing polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and other vinyl monomers.</p><p>
