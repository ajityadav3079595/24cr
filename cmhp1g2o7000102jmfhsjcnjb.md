# PP Hollow Board Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>PP Hollow Board, also known as flute board, double-wall board, or corrugated board, is a lightweight and durable material made from copolymer polypropylene. Produced through an extrusion process, it can be modified with various additives such as colorants, conductive materials, antistatic agents, and ultraviolet stabilizers. The material offers high impact resistance, waterproofing, oil resistance, and temperature resilience, making it suitable for diverse industrial applications. Additionally, PP Hollow Board is non-toxic, adheres to food GMP standards, and supports sustainable practices through reuse and recyclability.</p><p>
