# Infant Lactobacillus Powder Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Infant Lactobacillus Powder refers to a probiotic supplement designed specifically for infants. Probiotics are live microorganisms that provide numerous health benefits when consumed in adequate amounts. In infants, Lactobacillus strains help establish a healthy gut microbiome, improve digestion, enhance immunity, and prevent gastrointestinal issues such as colic and diarrhea. The two primary probiotic families used in infant formulations are <strong>Lactobacillus</strong> and <strong>Bifidobacterium</strong>, which play a crucial role in balancing gut bacteria and promoting overall health.</p><p>
