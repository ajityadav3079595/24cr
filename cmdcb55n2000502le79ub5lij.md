# Probiotics In The Liquid Animal Feed Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Probiotics in liquid animal feed refer to beneficial microorganisms, including bacteria and yeast, that are incorporated into liquid-based feed to enhance animal health and productivity. These probiotics aid in digestion, boost immunity, and improve feed conversion efficiency. Common probiotics include lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Bacillus species, Bifidobacterium, and Saccharomyces yeast strains. Their use in animal nutrition has gained significant traction due to growing awareness of sustainable livestock farming practices.</p><p>
