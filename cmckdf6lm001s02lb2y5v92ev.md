<strong>MARKET CHALLENGES</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Regulatory Complexity and Compliance Costs Challenge Market Expansion</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The cannabis extract market faces significant regulatory challenges due to varying legal frameworks across jurisdictions. While some regions have legalized cannabis, others maintain strict prohibition, creating a fragmented market. Even in legal markets, operators must navigate complex compliance requirements including licensing, product testing, packaging, and distribution regulations. These regulatory burdens increase operational costs and create barriers to market entry, particularly for smaller operators. The average compliance cost for a cannabis business can exceed $500,000 annually in some jurisdictions, significantly impacting profitability.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Other Challenges</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Banking and Financial Restrictions</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The federal prohibition of cannabis in countries like the United States creates banking challenges, with many financial institutions refusing to serve cannabis businesses. This forces companies to operate largely in cash, increasing security risks and operational difficulties. The lack of access to traditional banking services also limits investment and growth opportunities for cannabis businesses.</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Supply Chain Disruptions</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The cannabis industry experiences frequent supply chain disruptions due to regulatory changes, testing failures, and logistical challenges. These disruptions can lead to product shortages and inconsistent quality, undermining consumer confidence. The lack of interstate commerce in legal U.S. markets forces companies to maintain separate operations in each state, increasing costs and complexity.</p><p>
<strong>MARKET RESTRAINTS</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Limited Research and Clinical Data Restricting Medical Adoption</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Despite growing acceptance, the medical cannabis extract market faces significant restraints due to limited clinical research.
