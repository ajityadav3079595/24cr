Historical trends also show steady expansion due to the gradual shift towards solvent-based and waterborne polyurethane systems, where XDI plays a vital role. The high market share and dominance of XDI are particularly evident in the Asia Pacific region, where major end-user industries are rapidly scaling their operations, contributing to a surge in demand.</p><p>
</p><p>Xylylene Diisocyanate (XDI) is a specialized chemical compound primarily used in the synthesis of high-performance polyurethane materials. It appears as a colorless and transparent liquid with distinct physicochemical properties, such as a melting point of 10-12°C and a boiling point of 151°C at 0.8kPa. XDI is easily soluble in organic solvents like benzene, toluene, ethyl acetate, and acetone but demonstrates limited solubility in cyclohexane and petroleum ether. Thanks to its superior gloss retention, color stability, and thermal resistance, XDI is widely employed in applications demanding aesthetic durability and high resistance to environmental factors. These include automotive coatings, industrial finishes, and high-grade adhesives. Its performance characteristics are often compared to those of hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), with XDI offering additional value in specialized polyurethane applications.</p><p>
