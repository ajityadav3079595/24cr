</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Complex Regulatory Landscape to Hinder Market Expansion</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Despite growing acceptance, the CBPMs and dronabinol market faces significant regulatory challenges due to varying international drug scheduling policies. Many countries still classify cannabis derivatives as controlled substances with strict prescribing limitations, creating barriers to market entry and physician adoption. The lack of harmonized international standards necessitates costly, country-specific clinical trials and approval processes, often requiring 2-3 times the investment compared to conventional pharmaceuticals. This fragmented regulatory environment continues to limit the global availability of CBPMs, particularly in Asian and Middle Eastern markets where cannabis remains largely prohibited for medical use.</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Stigma and Limited Physician Education to Restrict Prescription Rates</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Persistent societal stigma surrounding cannabis use, coupled with inadequate physician education about endocannabinoid therapeutics, presents another major restraint. Recent surveys indicate that nearly 60% of general practitioners in newly legalized markets lack confidence in prescribing CBPMs due to limited training in cannabinoid pharmacology. This knowledge gap leads to continued underutilization even in regions where these medicines are legally accessible. Overcoming these barriers requires comprehensive medical education programs and clinical practice guidelines, which are only beginning to be implemented in most healthcare systems.</p><p>
<strong>MARKET CHALLENGES</strong></p><p>
