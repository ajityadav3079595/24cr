 <p>Automotive antifreeze is a liquid solution used to lower the freezing point of the water in a vehicle&#39;s cooling system. It is typically composed of glycol, acid, and other additives which have the ability to lower the freezing point and raise the boiling point of the water. Automotive antifreeze provides extra protection against engine corrosion and wear and also helps keep the engine from freezing during cold weather.</p>
