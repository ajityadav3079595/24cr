Phyto squalane offers numerous benefits, including hydration, skin barrier protection, and anti-aging effects. As consumers demand more natural and sustainable skincare solutions, phyto squalane is becoming increasingly popular, especially in facial oils, serums, moisturizers, and other beauty products.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The global phyto squalane market was valued at USD 75 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 94.14 million by 2030, demonstrating a compound annual growth rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 3.30% from 2024 to 2030.
