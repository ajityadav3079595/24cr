<h1>Potassium Carbonate Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:16px">Potassium carbonate (K2CO3), also known as potash carbonate, is a white, odorless inorganic compound commonly available in crystalline, granulated, or powder form. It is highly soluble in water, forming a strongly alkaline solution, and is used in a variety of industrial applications, including glass manufacturing, agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and the food industry. This versatile compound is primarily produced through electrolysis and ion exchange methods, with older techniques like the ash method becoming obsolete due to inefficiencies and environmental concerns</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">The global potassium carbonate market was valued at <strong>US$ 570.7 million in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>US$ 691.2 million by 2030</strong>, growing at a <strong><strong>CAGR</strong> of 2.8%</strong> during the forecast period. The market&#39;s steady growth is driven by increasing demand in industries such as glass and ceramics, agrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals. The rising adoption of potassium carbonate in food processing and its role in fertilizers contribute significantly to market expansion.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Growing Demand in the Glass and Ceramics Industry</strong>: Potassium carbonate is widely used in the production of high-quality glass and ceramics, with the sector accounting for a significant portion of global consumption.</span></p>
