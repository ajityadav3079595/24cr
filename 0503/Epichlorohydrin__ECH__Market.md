<h1>Epichlorohydrin (ECH) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:16px">Epichlorohydrin (ECH) is an essential chemical compound primarily used in the production of epoxy resins. It is an organochlorine compound with the molecular formula C3H5ClO. ECH is a colorless, volatile liquid with a pungent odor and is highly reactive due to its epoxide and chloro functional groups. It serves as a key intermediate in manufacturing synthetic glycerin, water treatment chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and other industrial products.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">The global Epichlorohydrin (ECH) market was valued at <strong>US$ 2,129.4 million in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>US$ 2,837.4 million by 2030</strong>, growing at a <strong><strong>CAGR</strong> of 4.2%</strong> during the forecast period. The market&#39;s expansion is driven by the rising demand for epoxy resins, particularly in the paints, electrical, and construction sectors. The increasing industrialization in emerging economies, particularly in <strong>China and India</strong>, further fuels demand.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Rising Demand for Epoxy Resins</strong>: ECH is a fundamental raw material in epoxy resin production, widely used in paints, electrical insulation, construction materials, and wind energy components.</span></p>
