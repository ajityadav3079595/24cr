<h1>Petroleum-Based Compostable Plastics Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:13px">Petroleum-based compostable plastics are a category of biodegradable plastics derived from petrochemical sources. Unlike traditional plastics that take hundreds of years to break down, compostable plastics are designed to degrade and turn into nutrient-rich compost under specific conditions. These materials are engineered to break down more quickly in industrial composting environments, making them a more environmentally friendly alternative to conventional plastics. Not all biodegradable plastics are compostable, as biodegradable plastics may degrade in various natural environments such as soil or water, while compostable plastics must degrade into compost when exposed to specific temperature, humidity, and microbial conditions.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p>The main types of petroleum-based compostable plastics include Polybutylene Succinate (PBS), Polybutylene Adipate Terephthalate (PBAT), and Poly-glycolic acid (PGA). These materials are widely used across various applications such as disposable packaging, tableware, and agricultural films due to their environmentally advantageous properties.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The global petroleum-based compostable plastics market was valued at USD 1.142 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow to USD 1.957 billion by 2030, exhibiting a robust compound annual growth rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 8.00% during the forecast period. This market growth is driven by the increasing demand for sustainable packaging solutions and the rising awareness about environmental issues related to plastic waste.</p>
