<h1>Picoxystrobin Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Picoxystrobin is a broad-spectrum fungicide belonging to the strobilurin class. It is widely used in agricultural applications to control various fungal diseases in crops such as cereals, fruits, and vegetables. Picoxystrobin works by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration in fungi, thereby preventing their growth and reproduction. Due to its effectiveness in protecting crops and improving yields, the demand for picoxystrobin has been steadily rising across various regions.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The global picoxystrobin market was valued at <strong>USD 425.70 million in 2023</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>USD 583.21 million by 2030</strong>, exhibiting a <strong><strong>CAGR</strong> of 4.60%</strong> during the forecast period. North America&#39;s picoxystrobin market size stood at <strong>USD 110.93 million in 2023</strong>, with a projected <strong>CAGR</strong> of <strong>3.94%</strong> from 2024 to 2030. This growth is primarily driven by increased agricultural activities, rising demand for high-quality crops, and ongoing advancements in fungicide formulations.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><strong>Growing Demand for High-Yield Crops</strong> ??? The increasing global population necessitates higher agricultural productivity, boosting the demand for effective fungicides like picoxystrobin.</p>
