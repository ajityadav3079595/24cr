</p><p>As an essential component of the automobile, the automobile lamp plays an important role in night lighting, driving signal, fog anti-collision, steering signs and other aspects, and is an important guarantee for the safe driving of the automobile. A large number of plastic materials are used in automobile lamps, such as PP, ABS/PC, etc. to make lamp shells, and PC materials to replace traditional glass as light distribution lenses. In the application of automobile lamp bonding, firstly, the lamp sealant shall be affected by the heat emitted by the bulb. Under the corresponding high temperature environment, it must ensure that its bonding and sealing properties do not change, and at the same time, it cannot release organic gas, produce atomization, and do not turn yellow, and affect the appearance; Secondly, when the lamp sealant is exposed to ultraviolet radiation in the sun, it will not crack the adhesive layer and other aging phenomena, which requires that the lamp sealant should have good ultraviolet aging resistance; The lamp sealant will also be eroded by water vapor and rain for a long time, so its sealing performance will not be affected.</p><p>
