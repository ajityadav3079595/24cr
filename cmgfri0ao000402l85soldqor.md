<strong>MARKET CHALLENGES</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Material Limitations in Extreme pH Conditions</strong></p><p>
</p><p>While polymeric membranes dominate the market, their vulnerability to extreme pH limits applications in mining and metal finishing. <strong>Testing shows PVDF membranes degrade 40% faster</strong> when exposed to pH 12 fluids common in mineral processing. Although ceramic alternatives exist, their 5-8x cost multiplier makes them impractical for most Southeast Asian operators. Membrane manufacturers are racing to develop hybrid materials that balance chemical resistance with affordabilityâa technical hurdle that remains unresolved.</p><p>
