The rising need for durable and crack-resistant concrete structures is also contributing to market expansion.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Definition</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Expansive cement is a specialized type of cement that undergoes volume expansion during the hydration process, ensuring minimal shrinkage and in some cases, slight expansion. This characteristic makes it ideal for applications where shrinkage can lead to structural issues, such as grouting, bridge construction, and repairing concrete cracks. Expansive cement is typically classified into silicate-type, aluminate-type, sulphoaluminate-type, and calcium aluminoferrite-type.</p><p>
