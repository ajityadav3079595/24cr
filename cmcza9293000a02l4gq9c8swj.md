Photovoltaic copper electroplating technology is an important means to achieve photovoltaic efficiency enhancement. Compared with other cost reduction methods, electroplated copper grid lines are thinner, which can greatly reduce the shading area and achieve the purpose of improving power generation efficiency. Since HJT (amorphous silicon thin film heterojunction) batteries use silver on both sides and the consumption of low-temperature silver paste is high, the electroplating copper technology is more in line with the cost reduction requirements of HJT batteries.</p><p>
