Manufacturers establishing local production facilities in these regions benefit from both reduced costs and faster regulatory approvals.</p><p>
<strong>MARKET CHALLENGES</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Material Supply Constraints Threaten Market Growth</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The clear aligner industry faces growing material supply challenges as demand outpaces specialty thermoplastic production capacity. Medical-grade PETG resins, the most commonly used clear aligner material, currently experience lead times of 12-16 weeks â nearly triple pre-pandemic levels. This supply-demand imbalance has forced some manufacturers to maintain 6-9 months of safety stock, increasing working capital requirements by an estimated 18%. The situation is further complicated by the limited number of FDA-approved material suppliers, with just three companies controlling over 85% of the medical-grade thermoplastic market.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Additional Industry Challenges</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Counterfeit Material Risks</strong></p><p>
