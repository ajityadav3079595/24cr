# Bleached Hardwood Kraft Pulp (BHKP) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Bleached Hardwood Kraft Pulp (BHKP) is a high-quality pulp derived from hardwood trees through a chemical pulping process known as Kraft pulping. The process involves cooking hardwood chips in a mixture of sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide to remove lignin while preserving cellulose fibers. The resulting pulp is then bleached to achieve high brightness and purity, making it suitable for various paper and packaging applications. BHKP is characterized by its short fiber length, which contributes to excellent formation, smooth surface properties, and enhanced opacity, absorbency, and bulk.</p><p>
