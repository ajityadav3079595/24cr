Polystyrene fluorescent microspheres are small, spherical particles made of polystyrene, a type of plastic, that are coated with fluorescent dyes. They are used in a variety of applications, including microscopy, flow cytometry, diagnostics, and as calibration standards. The fluorescent dyes are added to the polystyrene microspheres during the manufacturing process, and are chosen to emit a specific wavelength of light when excited by a light source. This makes them useful in applications where they can be used as markers or indicators, such as in biological imaging or environmental monitoring.</p><p>
