While aluminum dominates heat exchangers and some engine blocks, critical components like turbocharger housings still require alternative materials capable of withstanding temperatures exceeding <strong>300°C</strong>. Developing new aluminum compositions with enhanced thermal properties remains technically challenging and costly.</p><p>
<strong>MARKET OPPORTUNITIES</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Advanced Alloy Development for Next-Generation Vehicles</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Emerging aluminum-scandium compositions offer <strong>15-20%</strong> greater strength than conventional alloys while maintaining formability, ideal for complex structural components. Investments in additive manufacturing enable innovative aluminum applications like generative-designed brackets and integrated cooling channels. Continued progress in surface treatment technologies enhances corrosion resistance - particularly valuable for EV battery enclosures requiring <strong>15+ year lifespans</strong> under harsh operating conditions.</p><p>
