</p><p>The demand is particularly fueled by the resurgence of industrial activities post-pandemic, along with increased investments in infrastructure and power plants. In 2023 alone, more than 60% of new power generation facilities incorporated water cooling systems that require regular chemical treatment, highlighting the critical role of Cooling Tower Chemicals in modern industrial operations.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Cooling Tower Chemicals</strong>Â refer to a broad category of chemical formulations used to treat water in industrial and commercial cooling towers. These chemicals play a vital role in maintaining the efficiency and longevity of cooling systems by controlling issues such as scaling, corrosion, biological growth, and fouling. The chemicals are typically categorized into scale inhibitors, corrosion inhibitors, biocides, and dispersants. Each of these performs a specific function: for instance, scale inhibitors prevent mineral build-up, while biocides control microbial growth like algae and bacteria. Their application is essential across sectors like power generation, petrochemicals, HVAC systems, and manufacturing plants to ensure smooth and safe operations of cooling systems.</p><p>
