</p><p>Compared with other functional oligosaccharides, such as fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS) and galacto-oligosaccharide (GOS), the consumption of XOS in China increased quite slowly in recent years, due to its small serving size in downstream products and its low popularity among the Chinese public. Although FOS is currently the main functional oligosaccharide consumed in developed countries, its efficacy is not as good as that of XOS. Besides, the public's health consciousness in developed countries, such as the US, are higher than in China, which hints that products with health care function will be more popular in these countries.</p><p>
