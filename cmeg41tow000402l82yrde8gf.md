# Bio Naphtha Market, Global Outlook & Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Bio Naphtha refers to a bio-based fuel derived from renewable sources, such as vegetable oils, animal fats, and algae, through various processes like hydrotreating, gasification, pyrolysis, and fermentation. It serves as an alternative to conventional naphtha, offering a more sustainable option for industries such as chemicals, transportation, and energy. Bio Naphtha can be utilized for chemical feedstock, green plastic production, fuel blending, and as a solvent, significantly contributing to reducing the carbon footprint in comparison to fossil-derived products.</p><p>
