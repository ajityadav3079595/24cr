            https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/297364/food-grade-epsom-salt-market</a></b></div><br><p>The global food grade Epsom salt market size was valued at USD 287 million in 2024. The market is projected to grow from USD 305 million in 2025 to USD 423 million by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 5.6% during the forecast period.</p><p>
</p><p>Food grade Epsom salt is a purified form of magnesium sulfate (MgSOâ) approved for human consumption. Unlike industrial-grade variants, it undergoes stringent purification processes to remove impurities, making it suitable for culinary applications, dietary supplements, and personal care products. Its primary applications include use as a coagulant in tofu production, a brewing salt in beer-making, and a magnesium supplement for nutritional purposes.</p><p>
</p><p>The market growth is driven by increasing consumer awareness about magnesium deficiency and the rising demand for natural wellness products. While North America currently dominates the market with the U.S. accounting for approximately 35% of global revenue in 2024, the Asia-Pacific region is expected to witness the fastest growth due to expanding food processing industries. Key players like K+S, PQ Corporation, and Haifa collectively hold about 45% of the market share, with recent product innovations focusing on organic and ultra-pure formulations to meet stringent food safety standards.</p><p>
