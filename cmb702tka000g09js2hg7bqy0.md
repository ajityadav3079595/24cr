# Brominated SBS Market, Global Outlook & Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Brominated Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene (SBS) is a thermoplastic elastomer widely used as a flame retardant additive, particularly in insulation materials like Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) and Extruded Polystyrene (XPS). The bromination process enhances the fire resistance of SBS, making it a crucial component in the construction and packaging industries. Its unique properties include high thermal stability, excellent mechanical strength, and compatibility with various polymer matrices.</p><p>
