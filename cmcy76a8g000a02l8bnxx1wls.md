# Sludge Dispersant Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Sludge dispersants are chemical agents used to break down and disperse sludge in various industrial processes, primarily in the petroleum and water treatment sectors. These dispersants work by breaking water-in-oil emulsions and improving the flow properties of residual fuels, making them more homogeneous for combustion processes. In essence, sludge dispersants are designed to enhance the efficiency of energy production by making residual fuel oil more effective in combustion engines, reducing the risks of fuel clogging, and improving overall performance.</p><p>
