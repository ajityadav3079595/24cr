# Industrial Hook and Loop Fasteners Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Industrial Hook and Loop Fasteners, also known as Velcro, consist of two components: typically, two lineal fabric strips (or, alternatively, round "dots" or squares) which are attached (sewn or otherwise adhered) to the opposing surfaces to be fastened. The first component features tiny hooks, the second features smaller loops. When the two are pressed together, the hooks catch in the loops and the two pieces fasten or bind temporarily. When separated, by pulling or peeling the two surfaces apart, the strips make a distinctive "ripping" sound.</p><p>
