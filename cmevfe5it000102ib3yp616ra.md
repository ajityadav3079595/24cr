</p><p>The global key manufacturers of Iron Cobalt Vanadium Soft Magnetic Alloy include VACUUMSCHMELZE, Carpenter Technology Corporation, ShanghaiShuoye MetalMaterialCo., Ltd, ZhuoYi (Shanghai) Industrial Co.,Ltd, Xi'an Gangyan Special Alloy Co., Ltd, Shanghai Shengtong Metal Technology Co., Ltd and Suzhou A-one Special Alloy Co., Ltd, etc. in 2023, the global top five players have a share approximately % in terms of revenue.</p><p>
Among the existing soft magnetic materials, iron-cobalt-vanadium soft-magnetic alloy has the highest saturation magnetic induction (2.4T), high Curie point (980°C), and the largest saturation magnetostriction coefficient (60100×10-6). Due to the high saturation magnetic induction, when making a motor with the same power, the volume can be greatly reduced, and when it is used as an electromagnet, it can generate a large attraction force under the same cross-sectional area.</p><p>
</p><p>Due to the high Curie point, the alloy can work at a higher temperature where other soft magnetic materials have been completely demagnetized, and maintain good magnetic stability. Due to its large magnetostriction coefficient, it is extremely suitable for use as a magnetostrictive transducer, with high output energy and high work efficiency. The alloy has a low resistivity (0.27??·m) and is not suitable for use at high frequencies. It is expensive, easy to oxidize, and has poor processability. Adding an appropriate amount of nickel or other elements can improve its processability.</p><p>
