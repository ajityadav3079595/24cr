</p><p><strong>Historically, the semiconductor industry has seen consistent year-over-year expansion, and the reliance on high-purity materials like fused quartz has grown accordingly. The rise in fab construction and increased wafer sizes (moving from 200 mm to 300 mm and beyond) are also amplifying demand for superior quartz components.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Semiconductor Grade Fused Quartz refers to a high-purity form of quartz glass that is specifically processed to meet the stringent requirements of the semiconductor industry. This material is derived from silicon compounds such as silicon tetrachloride, which are reacted with oxygen and hydrogen at high temperatures to form transparent, amorphous silica. The absence of crystalline structure in fused quartz gives it excellent thermal shock resistance and high-temperature stability. It also possesses superior optical clarity, low thermal expansion, high dielectric strength, and exceptional chemical inertness.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Semiconductor-grade fused quartz is integral in the manufacturing of silicon wafers, photomasks, and other semiconductor components. Its resistance to contamination and ability to withstand extreme processing conditions make it a crucial material for photolithography, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and other fabrication steps in integrated circuit (IC) production.</strong></p><p>
