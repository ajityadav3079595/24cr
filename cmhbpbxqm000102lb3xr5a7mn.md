</p><p><strong>Historically, market growth has been aligned with industrial output and agricultural demand, with recent years seeing a surge in eco-conscious processes that support the use of ferrous sulfate over more hazardous alternatives.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Ferrous sulfate, chemically known as FeSO4, is an iron salt commonly found in two major forms: ferrous sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4•7H2O) and monohydrate (FeSO4•H2O). Among these, the heptahydrate variant is most prevalent in industrial applications and is typically referred to as copperas. This green, crystalline, water-soluble compound is acidic in nature and plays a pivotal role in numerous industries.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Ferrous sulfate is widely produced as a byproduct of two primary industrial processes: the titanium dioxide (TiO2) manufacturing process and steel pickling, where steel is treated with acid to remove rust or scale. Upon drying, ferrous sulfate heptahydrate transitions into a thermal monohydrate form, suitable for other specialized applications.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>This compound is extensively used across diverse sectors including water treatment, agriculture, animal feed, pigments, and pharmaceuticals. Its major utility stems from its role as a source of iron in iron-deficiency treatment and as a reducing agent in various chemical processes.</strong></p><p>
