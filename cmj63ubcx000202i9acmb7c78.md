These hurdles partially explain why only 14% of European medtech firms have fully transitioned critical components to AM despite the technology's obvious benefits for patient-matched solutions.</p><p>
<strong>MARKET CHALLENGES</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Material-Process Compatibility Issues</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The thermal properties enabling high-performance plastics' functionality also create processing challenges. PEEK requires chamber temperatures exceeding 180°C and build plate temperatures above 250°C - parameters only 23% of installed European industrial printers can reliably maintain. Warpage and layer adhesion issues result in 15-20% scrap rates for complex geometries, materially impacting total cost of ownership. Even advanced dual-extrusion systems struggle with PEKK's crystallization behavior, requiring specialized annealing protocols that extend production time by 300%. These technical barriers currently limit adoption to well-capitalized enterprises with dedicated AM engineering teams.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Other Challenges</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Workforce Shortages</strong></p><p>
