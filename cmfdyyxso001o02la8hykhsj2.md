</p><p>1,10-Phenanthroline Anhydrous is a specialized form used in coordination chemistry and as a chelating agent.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Report Overview</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Phenanthroline is an organic heterocyclic compound and a chelating agent with high affinity towards metal ions. The chemical is generally prepared by two consecutive sequential Skraup reactions of glycerol with o-phenylenediamine and an oxidizing agent such as traditional aqueous arsenic acid or nitrobenzene. Sulfuric acid is used as a catalysit in this reaction. After dehydration reaction acrolein is produced from glycerol and goes into further cyclization followed by reaction with amine to get condensed. 1, 10-phenanthroline anhydrous is majorly used as a chelating agent in various industries. It is also largely used in co-ordination chemistry as ligand (a bonding molecule which helps a central metal atom to form a co-ordination complex by binding). 1, 10-phenanthroline is soluble in water it is also soluble in organic solvents. The chemical is non-toxic in nature.</p><p>
