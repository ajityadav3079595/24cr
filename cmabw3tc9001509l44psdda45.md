</p><p><strong>Lithium Battery Electrolyte Film-forming Additives</strong> are specialized chemical compounds incorporated into the electrolyte formulations of lithium-ion batteries. Their primary function is to promote the formation of stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers on the anode and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layers on the cathode. These layers serve as protective barriers that mitigate undesirable side reactions between the electrode materials and the electrolyte, thereby enhancing the overall electrochemical performance of the battery.</p><p>
</p><p>These additives are typically used in small concentrations and are vital in extending battery life, boosting energy density, improving charge-discharge cycle stability, and enhancing performance in extreme conditions such as low temperatures. Popular additives include fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), vinylene carbonate (VC), lithium bis(oxalate)borate (LiBOB), and proprietary carbonate compounds, which are widely adopted in electric vehicles (EVs), portable electronics, and energy storage systems (ESS).</p><p>
