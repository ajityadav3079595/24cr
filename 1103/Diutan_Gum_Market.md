<h1>Diutan Gum Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:16px">Diutan Gum is a high-performance biopolymer derived from microbial fermentation, primarily produced by strains of <em>Sphingomonas elodea</em>. Structurally similar to xanthan gum, it is known for its exceptional stability and viscosity retention, even under extreme conditions such as high temperatures, salinity, and varying pH levels. These properties make Diutan Gum a preferred rheology modifier in industries such as oilfield drilling, construction, food processing, and agriculture.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">The global Diutan Gum market size was valued at US$ 342.7 million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 496.5 million by 2032, at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 4.7% during the forecast period 2025-2032.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">United States Diutan Gum market size was valued at US$ 78.6 million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 109.2 million by 2032, at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 4.2% during the forecast period 2025-2032.</span></p>
