</p><p>This growth is driven by increasing demand across various industries, including automotive, aerospace, electronics, and energy sectors.â</p><p>
</p><p>Brazing is a metal-joining process that involves the melting and flowing of a filler metal into the joint between two close-fitting parts. The filler metal has a melting point above 840°F (450°C) but below the melting point of the base metals. Capillary action draws the molten filler into the joint, creating a strong, leak-proof connection without melting the base materials</p><p>
