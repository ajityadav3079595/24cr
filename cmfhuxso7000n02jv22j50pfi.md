# ALF3 (Aluminium Fluoride) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030

<p>Aluminium Fluoride (AlF3) is an inorganic compound extensively used in the aluminium industry. It is a colorless, crystalline substance primarily employed as a flux to lower the melting point of aluminium oxide during the electrolytic production of aluminium. Additionally, it plays a significant role in the manufacturing of ceramics, glass, and as a catalyst in chemical processes. Its unique properties, such as high thermal stability and low solubility in water, make it indispensable in various industrial applications.</p><p>
