</p><p>The ECO market faces stiff competition from advanced synthetic rubbers like hydrogenated nitrile (HNBR) and fluoroelastomers (FKM), particularly in high-value applications. While ECO offers cost advantages (typically 30-40% lower than FKM), performance limitations in extreme chemical environments restrict its market penetration. Price competition has intensified as Asian manufacturers expand production, with average selling prices declining 3-5% annually in bulk applications. This erosion, combined with rising input costs, threatens profitability across the value chain.</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Technical Limitations in Specialty Applications</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Despite its excellent general properties, ECO exhibits certain performance constraints that limit adoption in critical applications. The material's moderate heat resistance (maximum 150Â°C continuous service temperature) prevents usage in high-temperature engine compartments where temperatures exceed 175Â°C. Similarly, ECO's swelling tendency in aromatic hydrocarbon environments restricts its use in certain chemical processing applications. Overcoming these limitations through compound modifications remains an ongoing challenge for material scientists, requiring substantial R&amp;D investments that may not yield commercially viable solutions.</p><p>
