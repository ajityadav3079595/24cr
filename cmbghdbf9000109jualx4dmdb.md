This is driven by increasing consumer awareness of environmentally friendly products and a well-established detergent manufacturing industry.</p><p>
</p><p>This growth reflects rising demand for sustainable and high-performance cleaning solutions, especially in residential and industrial sectors.</p><p>
</p><p>Detergent grade enzymes are specialized industrial enzymes used primarily in laundry and dishwashing detergents to enhance cleaning efficiency. These enzymes, including proteases, amylases, lipases, and cellulases, break down various types of stains such as proteins, starches, fats, and cellulose-based dirt at lower temperatures. Their unique ability to work effectively in cold water and maintain stability under alkaline conditions has made them indispensable in modern detergent formulations. Notably, their eco-friendliness, reduced need for harsh chemicals, and improved energy efficiency are aligned with global sustainability goals, positioning detergent enzymes as key components in green cleaning solutions.</p><p>
