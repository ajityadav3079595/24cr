</p><p>The market expansion is attributed to the increasing use of thioglycolic acid in cosmetic and personal care formulations, especially in emerging markets such as Asia-Pacific and Latin America.</p><p>
</p><p>Historically, the demand for thioglycolic acid has demonstrated resilience due to its essential role in the formulation of chemical depilatories and perm solutions. The personal care segment remains a dominant consumer of TGA, accounting for over 30% of the total market share in 2023. Meanwhile, the compound's application in corrosion inhibitors and scale removers for industrial machinery and oil wells is steadily increasing, further bolstering market growth.</p><p>
</p><p>Thioglycolic Acid (TGA), also known as mercaptoacetic acid, is a colorless liquid organic compound containing both a thiol and a carboxylic acid functional group. It is widely utilized as a chemical intermediate in various industrial processes. The dual functionality of thioglycolic acid gives it a unique reactivity profile, making it indispensable in applications such as hair care formulations (especially depilatory and perming products), metal cleaning and treatment, polymerization, and pharmaceuticals. It serves as a chelating agent, stabilizer, and additive across multiple industries.</p><p>
</p><p>The global Thioglycolic Acid market serves a diverse set of industries, from personal care and cosmetics to oil and gas, leather processing, and chemical manufacturing. The compound's ability to bind with metal ions and break disulfide bonds makes it a sought-after material in niche applications where other acids or thiols are less effective.</p><p>
