# Monobasic Potassium Phosphate Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Monobasic Potassium Phosphate (KH2PO4), also known as monopotassium phosphate, is a chemical compound primarily used for its properties in various industries, including agriculture, food, medical, and industrial sectors. This compound is soluble in water but insoluble in alcohol. It is hygroscopic and deliquescent, meaning it readily absorbs moisture from the environment. When heated to 400°C, it melts and transforms into a transparent liquid before solidifying into an opaque glassy material, commonly referred to as potassium metaphosphate (KPO3).</p><p>
</p><p>Monobasic Potassium Phosphate is primarily used as a fertilizer in agriculture, a food additive, and an ingredient in medical formulations. Its diverse applications have spurred its global market, offering numerous benefits for each sector. The compound is vital in providing potassium and phosphorus to plants, which are essential nutrients for growth and development.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
