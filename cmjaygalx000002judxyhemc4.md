</p><p>Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) tendons are emerging as credible alternatives to steel PC strand in certain applications. While currently <strong>3-4 times</strong> more expensive than conventional PC strand, FRP's corrosion resistance and electromagnetic neutrality make it attractive for specialized projects. The global FRP tendon market is growing at <strong>12% annually</strong>, particularly in coastal structures and medical facilities where non-metallic solutions are preferred. While unlikely to displace steel PC strand for most applications, these alternatives are capturing niche segments that traditionally used conventional prestressing solutions.</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Financing Constraints Limit Market Expansion</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Rising interest rates and tighter lending standards are creating headwinds for PC strand-intensive projects. Infrastructure projects requiring prestressed concrete typically have capital expenditure <strong>15-20% higher</strong> than conventional alternatives, making them particularly sensitive to financing conditions. In developing markets, currency depreciation has increased the local currency cost of imported PC strand by <strong>25-40%</strong> since 2022, forcing many projects to delay or scale back. These financial constraints are prompting some developers to opt for lower-cost construction methods, despite their inferior long-term performance characteristics.</p><p>
