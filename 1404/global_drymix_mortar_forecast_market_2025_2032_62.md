</p><p><strong>Dry powder mortar refers to a granular or powdery material that is physically mixed with dried and screened aggregates (such as quartz sand), inorganic cementitious materials (such as cement), and additives (such as polymers) in a certain proportion. It is transported to the construction site in bags or bulk, and can be directly used after mixing with water. Also known as mortar dry powder, dry mixed mortar, and dry mixed powder, some building adhesives also belong to this category. Dry powder mortar plays a bonding, cushioning, protective, and decorative role in the construction industry as a thin layer, and is widely used in construction and decoration engineering.</strong></p><p>
