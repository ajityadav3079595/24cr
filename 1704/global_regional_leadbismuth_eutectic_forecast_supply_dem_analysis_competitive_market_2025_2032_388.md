<h1>Lead-Bismuth Eutectic Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032: Supply and Demand analysis, Regional Analysis and Competitive</h1><p>Lead-Bismuth Eutectic (LBE) is a eutectic alloy consisting of lead (44.5 atomic percent) and bismuth (55.5 atomic percent). Known for its low melting point (approximately 123.5°C) and high boiling point (over 1,670°C), LBE serves as a highly effective coolant in nuclear reactors. Its primary application is in advanced reactor systems, such as the lead-cooled fast reactor (LFR), which is part of the Generation IV nuclear reactor initiative. The alloy is appreciated for its excellent thermal conductivity, chemical stability, and neutron absorption properties, making it a preferred choice for high-performance, safe nuclear energy systems.</p><p>
