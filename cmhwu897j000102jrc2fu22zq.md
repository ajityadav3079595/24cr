</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Growing Health Consciousness and Demand for Natural Ingredients to Propel Market Growth</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The global chicory root product market is experiencing significant growth, primarily driven by increasing consumer awareness about health and wellness. With rising concerns over obesity and digestive health issues, consumers are actively seeking natural alternatives to sugar and synthetic additives. Chicory root, rich in inulin fiber, has emerged as a preferred functional ingredient because it serves as both a prebiotic and sugar substitute. Recent industry analysis indicates that over 65% of consumers now prioritize products with clean-label ingredients, creating favorable conditions for chicory-based products.
