# Post Industrial Film Recycling Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Post-industrial film recycling refers to the process of reprocessing plastic film waste generated during industrial manufacturing. This includes film scraps, trimmings, and rejects from production lines. These materials are collected, cleaned, and recycled into usable plastic resins, reducing waste and environmental impact. The process helps industries meet sustainability goals while minimizing raw material costs.</p><p>
