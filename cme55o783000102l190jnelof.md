# Asia Pacific Metallurgical Coke  Market Research Report 2025-2032

<p>Metallurgical coke, commonly referred to as met coke, is a high-carbon material produced by the destructive distillation of coal in an oxygen-free environment. It serves as a crucial reducing agent and energy source in blast furnaces for iron and steel production. Metallurgical coke is characterized by its high strength, low ash content, and superior heating properties, making it indispensable in steel manufacturing. Other applications include foundries, non-ferrous metal production, and chemical processing industries.</p><p>
