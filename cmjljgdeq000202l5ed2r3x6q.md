</p><p>The region's market growth is primarily driven by increasing industrial applications and advancements in biotechnology and nanotechnology. The demand for PEI has been driven by its extensive use in industries such as pharmaceuticals, water treatment, and packaging.</p><p>
<strong>Market Size</strong></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Polyethylene Imine (PEI) is a synthetic polymer characterized by repeating units of amine groups and aliphatic ethylene spacers. It is commercially available in both linear and branched forms. Linear PEI consists exclusively of secondary amines, while branched PEI contains a mix of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines. Dendrimeric forms, which are highly branched and exhibit well-defined molecular structures, have also been developed.</p><p>
</p><p>Due to its high charge density, PEI is widely used in various industries, including biotechnology, paper manufacturing, adhesives, water treatment, and drug delivery. Industrial production of PEI has increased significantly due to its diverse applications and demand in different sectors.</p><p>
