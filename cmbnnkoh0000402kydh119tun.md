# Global Furfurylamine Market Research Report 2025-2032

<p>The global furfurylamine market was valued at <strong>US$ 126 million in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>US$ 193 million by 2032</strong>, exhibiting a <strong>Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 5.5%</strong> during the forecast period (2025-2032). This growth is driven by increasing demand from pharmaceutical applications and corrosion inhibitors. The market has shown steady expansion over the past decade, with particular acceleration in the Asia-Pacific region. The 2024 valuation represents a significant increase from previous years, reflecting the compound's growing importance in industrial applications.</p><p>
</p><p>Furfurylamine is an organic compound derived from furfural, a biomass-derived chemical. It is a colorless to pale yellow liquid with a characteristic amine odor, widely used as a building block in chemical synthesis. The compound serves as a key intermediate in pharmaceutical manufacturing and as a precursor for corrosion inhibitors. Its molecular structure makes it particularly valuable for creating nitrogen-containing compounds. The global market encompasses both high-purity (&gt;99%) and standard purity (&gt;98%) grades, with applications spanning multiple industries. Furfurylamine's versatility and relatively low production cost have made it a staple in specialty chemical manufacturing.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
