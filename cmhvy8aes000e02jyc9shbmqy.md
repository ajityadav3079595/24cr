</p><p>Copper nickel sheets, also known as cupronickel alloys, are corrosion-resistant materials composed primarily of copper with nickel as the main alloying element. These sheets are widely used across industries due to their excellent resistance to saltwater corrosion, biofouling prevention, and thermal conductivity. The most common grades include Cu-Ni 90/10 (90% copper, 10% nickel) and Cu-Ni 70/30 (70% copper, 30% nickel), with the latter offering superior strength and corrosion resistance.</p><p>
</p><p>The market growth is driven by expanding applications in marine engineering, offshore oil &amp; gas infrastructure, and desalination plants. Recent developments in renewable energy storage systems, particularly in battery technology, have further increased demand. While Asia-Pacific dominates consumption due to shipbuilding activities, North America shows strong growth potential with increasing offshore wind farm installations. Key manufacturers like Hitesh Steel and Changzhou DLX Alloy are expanding production capacities to meet this rising demand, particularly for high-grade Cu-Ni 70/30 sheets used in critical marine applications.</p><p>
<strong>MARKET DRIVERS</strong></p><p>
