Additionally, the pharmaceutical segment is rapidly emerging as a dominant force in the biotin market, driven by increasing clinical research and the use of biotin in treating conditions like multiple sclerosis, brittle nails, and biotin deficiency disorders.</p><p>
</p><p>Furthermore, the animal nutrition sector, particularly poultry and livestock, has shown robust demand for biotin-enriched feed, boosting the market expansion. E-commerce platforms have also played a pivotal role in enhancing product accessibility, thereby broadening the consumer base.</p><p>
</p><p>Biotin, also known as vitamin B7 or vitamin H, is a water-soluble member of the B-complex group of vitamins. It plays a crucial role in various metabolic processes in the human body, particularly in the metabolism of fats, carbohydrates, and amino acids. Biotin is essential for maintaining healthy hair, skin, and nails, and is often included in a variety of personal care products and dietary supplements for this reason. Found naturally in foods like eggs, nuts, and whole grains, biotin is also available in synthetic form and used widely in pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and animal feed.</p><p>
</p><p>The biotin market encompasses the production, distribution, and consumption of biotin in its various forms—such as D-biotin and synthetic biotin—across multiple end-use industries. These include dietary supplements, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and personal care, and animal nutrition.
