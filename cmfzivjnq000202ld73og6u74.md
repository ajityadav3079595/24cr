</p><p>This market growth is attributed to the increasing demand for corrosion-resistant materials in the construction sector, particularly in regions with high humidity and coastal areas. Additionally, the growing emphasis on sustainable construction materials and the longevity of Galvalume Steel contribute to its expanding market size.</p><p>
<strong>Market Size</strong></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Galvalume Steel for Construction refers to a specialized type of coated steel known for its durability, corrosion resistance, and versatile applications. This steel is coated with a mixture of 55% aluminum, 43.5% zinc, and 1.5% silicon using a continuous hot-dip process. The alloy layer forms a tightly bonded coating that enhances the steel's longevity, making it suitable for various construction purposes such as roofing, siding, and structural frameworks. The combination of zinc and aluminum ensures superior protection against rust, while silicon improves adhesion and coating uniformity.</p><p>
