# Metal Shot Peening Abrasives Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Shot peening is a highly effective mechanical process designed to enhance the properties and performance of metal components. By bombarding a metal surface with spherical particles known as shot peening abrasives, the process induces beneficial residual compressive stresses. These stresses improve the fatigue strength, durability, and resistance to stress corrosion cracking of the treated parts. Commonly used in industries such as aerospace, automotive, and construction, metal shot peening abrasives play a crucial role in extending the life of critical components under heavy operational loads.</p><p>
