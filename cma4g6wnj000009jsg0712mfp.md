</p><p>Firefighting foam is a specialized fire suppression agent used to extinguish and control fires by cooling the fire and coating the fuel to prevent its contact with oxygen, thereby interrupting the combustion process. It is particularly effective for liquid fuel fires and is widely used in industrial settings, oil and gas facilities, and wildland fire suppression. Firefighting foams are generally categorized into various types, such as protein-based, synthetic, and Class A foams, each designed for specific fire scenarios.</p><p>
