</p><p>Historically, the market has shown a consistent upward trajectory. For instance, between 2015 and 2023, the market experienced steady growth due to expanded insurance coverage, greater educational initiatives regarding mental health, and broader regulatory approval of ADHD drugs. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted traditional educational and workplace environments, also led to increased ADHD evaluations and diagnoses due to heightened awareness of cognitive and behavioral challenges.</p><p>
</p><p>Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that typically manifests in childhood and can persist into adulthood. Characterized by symptoms such as inattentiveness, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, ADHD significantly impacts academic, occupational, and social functioning. The ADHD drugs market comprises pharmaceutical treatments aimed at managing and mitigating these symptoms. These drugs are categorized primarily into stimulants (such as methylphenidate and amphetamine-based products) and non-stimulants (such as atomoxetine and guanfacine). The medications function by targeting neurotransmitters in the brain, particularly dopamine and norepinephrine, to improve concentration and reduce impulsive behavior.</p><p>
</p><p>The increasing recognition of ADHD across the globe, particularly among adults, has led to higher diagnosis rates and a corresponding demand for effective therapeutic options. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies have invested in research and development to introduce novel drug formulations with better efficacy, extended-release mechanisms, and reduced side effects.</p><p>
