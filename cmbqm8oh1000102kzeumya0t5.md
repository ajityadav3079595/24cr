</p><p><strong>The market's expansion is primarily attributed to the rise in semiconductor applications, escalating demand for miniaturized electronics, and the need for higher energy efficiency and performance in devices. The growth is also being propelled by government initiatives supporting semiconductor manufacturing and the increasing prevalence of electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy technologies.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Epitaxy is a fundamental process in semiconductor manufacturing, wherein a crystalline layer of material is deposited on a crystalline substrate. This deposition occurs in such a way that the deposited layer (the epitaxial layer) mimics the crystalline structure of the underlying substrate. The resulting structure, called an epi-wafer, is used in a wide range of electronic and optoelectronic applications. Epi wafers are integral to the development of advanced devices including high-speed transistors, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), solar cells, and laser diodes.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>These wafers are predominantly produced using techniques such as Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE), and Hydride Vapor Phase Epitaxy (HVPE). By enabling precise control over the thickness, composition, and doping profile of the semiconductor layers, epitaxy supports the fabrication of high-performance devices tailored for specific functionalities.</strong></p><p>
