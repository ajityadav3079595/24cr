# Renewable Gasoline Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Renewable gasoline, also referred to as biogasoline or "green" gasoline, is a sustainable transportation fuel derived from biomass. Unlike conventional gasoline, which is refined from crude oil, renewable gasoline is produced through processes like hydrothermal liquefaction, pyrolysis, and biomass gasification. It is chemically similar to petroleum-based gasoline and can be used in existing internal combustion engines without modifications. In the U.S., renewable gasoline must meet the <strong>ASTM D4814</strong> standard, while in Europe, it complies with the <strong>EN 228</strong> specification.</p><p>
