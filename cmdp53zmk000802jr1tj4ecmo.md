# N-Tridecane Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p><strong>N-Tridecane</strong>, a straight-chain alkane with the chemical formula <strong>CââHââ</strong>, is a colorless, flammable liquid hydrocarbon derived primarily from petroleum. It belongs to the family of alkanes, often referred to as paraffins. N-Tridecane is commonly used in the chemical industry as a <strong>distillation chaser</strong>, solvent, and reference standard for gas chromatography due to its stability and well-defined boiling point.</p><p>
</p><p>In industrial applications, N-Tridecane serves as a key ingredient in the formulation of fuels, solvents, and specialty chemicals. Its role as a distillation chaser enhances the separation process in fractional distillation, especially for high-boiling-point substances. It is also valued for its <strong>low volatility, high flash point</strong>, and compatibility with organic compounds.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
