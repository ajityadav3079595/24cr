# Europe Sputtering Targets Market, Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Sputtering targets are high-purity materials used in physical vapor deposition (PVD) processes to create thin films on various substrates. These materials play a critical role in the manufacturing of semiconductors, solar panels, flat-panel displays, and optical communication devices. The sputtering process involves bombarding a target material with high-energy ions, causing atoms to be ejected and deposited onto a substrate, forming a thin film with desired properties.</p><p>
