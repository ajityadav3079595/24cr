<h1>Ethylene Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:16px">Ethylene (C2H4) is a hydrocarbon compound classified as an alkene, characterized by a carbon-carbon double bond. It is one of the most widely produced organic compounds globally, serving as a key building block in the petrochemical industry. Ethylene is primarily derived from sources such as ethane, naphtha, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) through steam cracking. It is extensively utilized in producing polyethylene (PE), ethylene oxide/ethylene glycol (EO/EG), styrene monomer (SM), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and other chemicals.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">The global ethylene market was valued at <strong>US$ 179.59 billion in 2022</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>US$ 299.13 billion by 2029</strong>, registering a <strong><strong>CAGR</strong> of 7.6%</strong> during the forecast period. The market???s growth is driven by increasing demand for polyethylene, rising applications in the packaging industry, and expanding petrochemical infrastructure in Asia-Pacific. Historical trends indicate steady growth, supported by industrial expansion and technological advancements in ethylene production.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Rising Demand for Polyethylene</strong>: The surge in global consumption of polyethylene, particularly in packaging and consumer goods, is a major driver for ethylene demand.</span></p>
