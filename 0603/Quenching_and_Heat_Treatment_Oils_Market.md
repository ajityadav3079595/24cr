<h1>Quenching and Heat Treatment Oils Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:14px">Quenching is a process in materials science that involves the rapid cooling of a workpiece using water, oil, or air to achieve specific material properties. It is a type of heat treatment that helps prevent undesired low-temperature processes, such as phase transformations, by reducing the window of time during which these reactions can occur. Quenching can also enhance the hardness of both metallic and plastic materials by reducing the crystal grain size.</span></p>
