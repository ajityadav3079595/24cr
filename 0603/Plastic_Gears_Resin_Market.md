 <p><span style="font-size:14px">Plastic gears are mechanical components made from high-performance engineering plastics, designed to transmit power and motion in various applications. Unlike their metal counterparts, plastic gears offer advantages such as lightweight composition, corrosion resistance, reduced noise, and self-lubrication properties. These gears are typically manufactured from materials like polyacetal (POM), MC Nylon (polyamide resin), ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (U-PE), and polyether ether ketone (PEEK). The plastic gears resin market encompasses the production, distribution, and application of these advanced polymeric materials in industries such as automotive, medical devices, consumer electronics, and industrial machinery.</span></p>
