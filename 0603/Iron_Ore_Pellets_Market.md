<h1>Iron Ore Pellets Market, Global Outlook & Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:16px">Iron ore pellets are small, spherical agglomerations of iron ore fines combined with binders such as bentonite clay and fired at high temperatures to create a hardened product. These pellets serve as a primary raw material in steel manufacturing, enhancing efficiency in blast furnaces and direct reduction processes. Compared to sinter and lump ore, iron ore pellets offer higher iron content (typically 65-70%), resulting in energy savings and improved steel production performance.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">The global Iron Ore Pellets market was valued at <strong>US$ 51,517.04 million in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>US$ 66,640.92 million by 2030</strong>, growing at a <strong><strong>CAGR</strong> of 3.79%</strong> during the forecast period from 2024 to 2030.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Total Industry Sales:</strong> The total volume sold by all manufacturers amounted to <strong>224,287.45 K TON</strong>, indicating a dynamic and robust market.</span></p>
