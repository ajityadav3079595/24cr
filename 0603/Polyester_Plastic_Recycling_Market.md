 <p><span style="font-size:14px">Polyester plastic recycling refers to the process of collecting, sorting, processing, and reusing polyester-based plastic materials to minimize environmental impact and promote sustainability. Polyester is a synthetic polymer widely used in textile manufacturing, packaging materials, and plastic bottles. Recycling polyester plastic involves mechanical and chemical methods to convert post-consumer and post-industrial waste into reusable raw materials, reducing dependence on virgin polyester production and mitigating plastic pollution.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Rising Environmental Concerns</strong>: Growing awareness of plastic waste pollution and government initiatives promoting sustainability are driving demand for polyester recycling.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Increasing Demand for Sustainable Textiles</strong>: The fashion and apparel industry is increasingly adopting recycled polyester (rPET) to reduce environmental impact.</span></p>
