<h1>Phytase Enzyme for Poultry Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Phytase is a crucial enzyme widely used in poultry feed to enhance phosphorus availability from plant-based sources. It helps in breaking down <strong>phytic acid</strong>, a naturally occurring anti-nutrient in grains and oilseeds, into more digestible forms of phosphorus.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Derived primarily from microbial sources such as <em>Pichia pastoris</em>, phytase is available in different formulations, including granular, powder, liquid, and thermostable forms. By supplementing poultry diets with phytase, farmers can <strong>enhance nutrient utilization, reduce feed costs, and minimize phosphorus excretion into the environment</strong>, addressing both economic and ecological concerns.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The <strong>global phytase enzyme for poultry market</strong> was valued at <strong>USD 175 million in 2023</strong> and is projected to grow to <strong>USD 249.54 million by 2030</strong>, registering a <strong><strong>CAGR</strong> of 5.20%</strong> during the forecast period.</p>
