<h1>Methylene Diphenyl Diisocyanate (MDI) Market, Global Outlook & Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:16px">Methylene Diphenyl Diisocyanate (MDI) is an aromatic diisocyanate commonly used in the production of polyurethane foams, elastomers, adhesives, and coatings. The compound is known for its versatility, reacting with polyols to form polyurethanes, which find application across a wide array of industries. MDI exists in several isomers, primarily 2,2&#39;-MDI, 2,4&#39;-MDI, and 4,4&#39;-MDI, differentiated by the position of the isocyanate groups on the phenyl rings. The most commonly produced and used form of MDI is 4,4&#39;-MDI due to its robust properties and efficacy in polyurethane manufacturing.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">MDI&#39;s primary applications include rigid and flexible foams, coatings, adhesives, elastomers, and sealants. It is a key raw material in the automotive, construction, furniture, and electronics industries due to its role in creating materials with high durability, flexibility, and resistance to wear and tear.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">The global Methylene Diphenyl Diisocyanate (MDI) market size was valued at USD 16.92 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow to USD 22.66 billion by 2032, representing a compound annual growth rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 3.30% over the forecast period. This growth is driven by the increasing demand for polyurethane products in various sectors, such as automotive, construction, and consumer goods.</span></p>
