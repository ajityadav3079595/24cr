<h1>Chromium Trioxide (Chromic Anhydride) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:16px">Chromium trioxide, also known as chromic anhydride, is a highly oxidizing compound with the molecular formula CrO3 and a molecular weight of 99.99. This dark red or dark purple orthorhombic crystalline substance is highly soluble in water and exhibits strong deliquescence properties. Chromium trioxide is widely used in industries for electroplating, as an oxidant, catalyst, wood preservative, and in the production of chromium compounds. It is commonly synthesized by reacting concentrated sulfuric acid with potassium dichromate.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">The <strong>Global Chromium Trioxide Market</strong> was valued at approximately <strong>US$ 576 million in 2024</strong> and is projected to grow to <strong>US$ 679 million by 2031</strong>, representing a <strong><strong>CAGR</strong> of 2.4%</strong> during the forecast period from <strong>2025 to 2031</strong>. This moderate growth can be attributed to increasing industrial demand, particularly in electroplating and metal finishing applications, as well as regulatory scrutiny on chromium-based chemicals due to environmental and health concerns.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Growing demand in electroplating applications:</strong> Chromium trioxide is extensively used in the automotive, aerospace, and industrial manufacturing sectors for electroplating and metal coating, enhancing corrosion resistance and aesthetic appeal.</span></p>
