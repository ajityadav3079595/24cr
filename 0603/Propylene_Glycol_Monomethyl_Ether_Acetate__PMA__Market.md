<h1>Propylene Glycol Monomethyl Ether Acetate (PMA) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:16px">Propylene Glycol Monomethyl Ether Acetate (PGMEA), also known as propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PMA), is a colorless, hygroscopic solvent with a mild odor. It is widely used across various industries due to its excellent solvency properties, making it an essential component in coatings, inks, and cleaning applications. The chemical formula of PGMEA is C6H12O3. Due to its low toxicity and environmentally friendly nature, PGMEA is a preferred solvent in several high-tech applications, including semiconductor manufacturing and liquid crystal display (LCD) cleaning. However, it is flammable and may form explosive vapor-air mixtures when heated above 42??C.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">The global Propylene Glycol Monomethyl Ether Acetate (PMA) market was valued at approximately USD 735.60 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 968.00 million by 2030. This growth represents a compound annual growth rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 4.00% over the forecast period. The increasing demand for eco-friendly and high-performance solvents is a key driver of this market expansion. In North America, the PMA market was valued at USD 191.68 million in 2023 and is expected to grow at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 3.43% between 2025 and 2030.</span></p>
