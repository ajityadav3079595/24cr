<h1>Caprolactone Market, Global Outlook & Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:16px">Caprolactone is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a seven-membered ring derived from caproic acid. It is a colorless liquid that is highly miscible with most organic solvents and water. Caprolactone is widely used as a precursor in the production of caprolactam and polycaprolactone polymers. Its chemical properties make it an essential raw material in the manufacturing of various high-performance resins, coatings, adhesives, and biomedical applications.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">The global caprolactone market was valued at <strong>USD 253.40 million in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>USD 277.08 million by 2030</strong>, growing at a <strong><strong>CAGR</strong> of 1.50%</strong> during the forecast period. This moderate growth is driven by the increasing demand for polycaprolactone in the production of high-performance thermoplastics, medical-grade resins, and specialty coatings.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Rising Demand for Biodegradable Polymers</strong>: The increasing preference for sustainable and eco-friendly materials is fueling the adoption of polycaprolactone in medical and industrial applications.</span></p>
