<h1>North America Hemp Fiber Market, Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:16px">Hemp fiber is derived from the stalk of the hemp plant and is known for its durability, strength, and versatility. There are two primary types of hemp fibers: long bast fibers and short core fibers. Bast fibers are similar in length to softwood fibers and have a low lignin content, making them suitable for textiles and high-performance applications. Short core fibers resemble hardwood fibers and are commonly used in composite materials and paper production.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">With a resurgence in eco-friendly and sustainable materials, hemp fiber has gained significant traction across various industries. Its biodegradable nature, coupled with its high tensile strength, makes it an attractive alternative to synthetic and other natural fibers. The hemp fiber market is experiencing growth due to increasing demand for sustainable materials in textiles, automotive, and construction industries.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">The North America Hemp Fiber Market was valued at <strong>USD 248.71 million in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>USD 335.20 million by 2030</strong>, growing at a <strong><strong>CAGR</strong> of 5.10%</strong> during the forecast period.</span></p>
