<h1>PBS Resin Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:16px">Polybutylene Succinate (PBS) resin is a biodegradable polyester that is widely used in various applications, primarily due to its environmental benefits. PBS is derived from renewable resources and can break down in the environment over time, making it an eco-friendly alternative to conventional plastics. This semi-crystalline polymer has gained significant attention because of its versatility in manufacturing biodegradable plastics for disposable packaging, agricultural films, and disposable tableware. PBS resin is known for its excellent mechanical properties, such as high tensile strength, flexibility, and thermal stability. It is soluble in chloroform but only slightly soluble in tetrahydrofuran and almost insoluble in methanol, ethanol, and water.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">PBS is produced by polymerizing succinic acid with 1,4-butanediol, and its chemical structure is H-[O(CH2)4OOC(CH2)2CO]n-OH. Its applications range from biodegradable packaging and tableware to agricultural films, making it a prominent player in the global bio-based polymer market.</span></p>
