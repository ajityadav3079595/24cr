<h1>Sponge Titanium Market, Global Outlook & Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:16px">Sponge titanium is a highly pure form of titanium metal produced through the Kroll process, where titanium tetrachloride is reduced using magnesium or sodium. The material is widely used in aerospace, defense, chemical processing, and marine applications due to its lightweight, corrosion resistance, and high strength-to-weight ratio. Sponge titanium serves as the primary raw material for titanium ingots and subsequent products such as sheets, bars, and powders used across various industries.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">The global sponge titanium market was valued at <strong>US$ 2,445.2 million in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>US$ 3,079.4 million by 2030</strong>, growing at a <strong><strong>CAGR</strong> of 3.3%</strong> during the forecast period. Market growth is primarily driven by increasing demand in aerospace and defense applications, rising industrial usage in chemical processing, and advancements in titanium extraction technologies. The market experienced disruptions due to COVID-19 and geopolitical factors such as the <strong>Russia-Ukraine war</strong>, but it has demonstrated resilience, with strong recovery expected in key manufacturing hubs.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Growing Aerospace and Defense Industry:</strong> The increasing production of commercial and military aircraft is a major demand driver for sponge titanium, which is used in airframes and jet engines.</span></p>
