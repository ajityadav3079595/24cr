<h1>EUV Pellicle Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:16px">The Global EUV Pellicle Market is an essential segment within the semiconductor manufacturing industry, specifically catering to Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography processes. EUV pellicles are ultra-thin membrane materials used to protect photomasks from contamination during semiconductor wafer fabrication. These pellicles enhance yield rates and maintain the integrity of high-precision lithographic processes by preventing particle deposition on the mask surface. The increasing demand for EUV lithography in advanced semiconductor nodes (e.g., 5nm and below) has significantly driven the adoption of EUV pellicles in the industry.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">The EUV pellicle market was valued at <strong>US$190 million in 2024</strong> and is projected to grow at a <strong><strong>CAGR</strong> of 15%</strong> to reach <strong>US$440 million by 2030</strong>. This robust growth is attributed to the escalating demand for semiconductor chips in various industries such as artificial intelligence, IoT, and high-performance computing. Additionally, as leading semiconductor foundries, including TSMC, Intel, and Samsung, continue their transition to EUV lithography for advanced chip production, the need for high-transmittance EUV pellicles will surge.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Historical Growth:</strong> The market has expanded consistently, with rising investments in EUV lithography by semiconductor manufacturers.</span></p>
