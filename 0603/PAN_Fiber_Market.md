<h1>PAN Fiber Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:13px">Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is a synthetic polymer commonly used in the production of high-performance fibers. With the chemical formula (C3H3N)n, it is a semicrystalline organic resin. PAN is thermoplastic in nature, which means it softens when heated, but it does not melt under normal conditions???it degrades before reaching its melting point. It is known by several other names, including polyvinyl cyanide and Creslan 61.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p>This polymer is an essential raw material for manufacturing carbon fibers, which are widely used in industries like aerospace, automotive, and sports equipment. PAN fibers also find applications in clothing, home furnishings, industrial uses, and more. With its versatile properties, PAN is considered a key material in multiple sectors, contributing significantly to the global textile and chemical industries.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The global PAN fiber market has been experiencing consistent growth. As of 2023, the market was valued at approximately USD 1.14 billion. It is projected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 5.80%, reaching an estimated market size of USD 1.69 billion by 2030. This growth is primarily driven by increased demand across various sectors, especially in the textile and industrial applications.</p>
