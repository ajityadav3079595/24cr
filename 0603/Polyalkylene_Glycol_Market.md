<h1>Polyalkylene Glycol Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:16px">Polyalkylene glycol (PAG) refers to a family of synthetic polymers that are formed by the polymerization of alkylene oxides, such as propylene oxide and ethylene oxide, with alcohols. This versatile polymer can be used in a variety of applications due to its excellent solubility, low volatility, and high thermal stability. PAGs are widely employed in industrial, automotive, pharmaceutical, and personal care products, making them essential components in several manufacturing processes.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">The product types within the polyalkylene glycol market include <strong>polypropylene glycol</strong> (PPG) and <strong>polyethylene glycol</strong> (PEG), each serving distinct industries. Polypropylene glycol, for example, is primarily used in applications such as lubricants, antifreeze, and PU foams, while polyethylene glycol is more commonly found in pharmaceuticals, personal care, and food additives.</span></p>
