<h1>Hydrodemetallization (HDM) Catalyst Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:16px">Hydrodemetallization (HDM) Catalyst is a crucial component in the oil refining industry, specifically designed to remove metal contaminants such as nickel, vanadium, and iron from crude oil. These metals, if left unremoved, can lead to equipment corrosion, catalyst poisoning, and lower efficiency in refining operations. HDM catalysts facilitate the reaction between hydrogen and metal impurities, converting them into less harmful compounds that can be efficiently separated from the oil stream. This process enhances the quality of refined petroleum products while prolonging the lifespan of refinery equipment.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">The global Hydrodemetallization (HDM) Catalyst market has witnessed steady growth in recent years. In 2023, the market was valued at approximately USD 187 million. With increasing demand for high-purity petroleum products and stringent regulations on fuel quality, the market is projected to expand at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 4.60%, reaching USD 280.30 million by 2032.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">Regionally, North America held a significant share in 2023, with an estimated market size of USD 52.65 million. The North American market is forecasted to grow at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 3.94% from 2025 to 2032, driven by the region&#39;s advanced refining capabilities and rising investments in hydroprocessing technology.</span></p>
