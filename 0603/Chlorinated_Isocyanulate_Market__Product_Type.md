<h1>Chlorinated Isocyanulate Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032, by Manufacturers, Regions, Technology, Application, Product Type</h1><br/><p><span style="font-size:16px">Chlorinated Isocyanurate refers to a class of disinfectant chemicals widely used for water treatment, hygiene applications, and industrial processes. These compounds, primarily Trichloroisocyanuric Acid (TCCA) and Sodium Dichloroisocyanurate (SDIC), act as powerful oxidizing agents. They release chlorine to kill bacteria, viruses, and algae, making them essential in swimming pool sanitation, drinking water purification, and textile processing. The demand for chlorinated isocyanurate is driven by its high efficacy, long shelf life, and cost-effectiveness compared to alternative disinfectants.</span></p>
 
 
 
 <p><span style="font-size:16px">The Chlorinated Isocyanurate Market was valued at USD 741.36 million in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 1.06 billion by 2032, growing at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (<strong>CAGR</strong>) of 4.5% during the forecast period (2025-2032).</span></p>
