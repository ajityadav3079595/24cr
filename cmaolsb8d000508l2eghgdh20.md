</p><p><strong>Sendust magnetics powder cores</strong> are specialized magnetic materials composed of an alloy consisting of <strong>6% aluminum, 9% silicon, and 85% iron.</strong> These cores are known for their <strong>low core losses</strong>, <strong>excellent temperature stability</strong>, and <strong>minimal magnetostriction,</strong> which significantly reduces audible noise in electrical applications. Sendust cores exhibit a saturation flux density of around <strong>1 Tesla</strong> and tend to lose inductance with increasing temperature.</p><p>
</p><p>This property can be leveraged in composite core designs to achieve <strong>temperature compensation</strong>, making them suitable for <strong>switching power supplies, pulse transformers, in-line noise filters, swing chokes, and phase-fired controller filters</strong> (e.g., light dimmers).</p><p>
