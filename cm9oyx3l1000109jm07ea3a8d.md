# Semiconductor Underfill Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p><strong>Semiconductor underfill</strong> is an epoxy-based material used to fill the gap between a semiconductor die and its package substrate. This material plays a critical role in improving the mechanical and thermal reliability of semiconductor devices by mitigating stresses induced by thermal expansion mismatches. Semiconductor underfill enhances the lifespan of electronic devices by protecting them against thermal cycling, moisture, and mechanical shocks. It is widely used in applications such as flip-chip packaging, ball grid arrays (BGA), and chip-scale packages (CSP).</p><p>
