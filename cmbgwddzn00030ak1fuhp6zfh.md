# Carbon and Graphite Felt Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Felts are soft, flexible, high-temperature refractory insulation materials used in vacuum and protected atmosphere environments up to 3000°C. Carbon and Graphite Felts are produced by pressing, matting, and condensing fibers together. Carbon felt turns into graphite fiber felt after exposure to high temperatures above 2000°C in a vacuum or inert atmosphere, with a carbon content of 99% min.</p><p>
