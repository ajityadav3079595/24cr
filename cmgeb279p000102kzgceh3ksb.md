</p><p>Omega-3 fatty acids, also called n-3 fatty acids, are polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) essential for human health. These nutrients contain a double bond at the third carbon atom from the methyl end of their carbon chain. The three primary types are <strong>alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)</strong> from plant sources, and <strong>eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)</strong> and <strong>docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)</strong> primarily derived from marine sources. Since the human body cannot synthesize them, they must be obtained through diet or supplements, playing critical roles in brain function, cardiovascular health, and inflammation regulation.</p><p>
</p><p>The market growth is driven by increasing consumer awareness of Omega-3's health benefits, particularly in heart and cognitive health. North America currently dominates with nearly <strong>35% market share</strong>, while the top four manufacturers collectively hold over <strong>40%</strong> of the global market.
