</p><p> This modest yet steady growth reflects a balanced demand across key industries including automotive, construction, and industrial manufacturing.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Industrial Dimer Acid</strong> is a type of fatty acid derived primarily from the dimerization of unsaturated fatty acids, most notably oleic acid. The process of dimerization involves the chemical reaction of two fatty acid molecules to form a dimeric structure, resulting in a compound with enhanced thermal and oxidative stability. Industrial dimer acids are typically yellow to brown viscous liquids and are known for their non-toxic, biodegradable, and flexible properties. These attributes make them valuable in the production of polyamide resins, adhesives, lubricants, and corrosion inhibitors. As sustainability gains traction in industrial processes, dimer acids, especially those sourced from renewable feedstocks, are witnessing increased demand across various sectors.</p><p>
