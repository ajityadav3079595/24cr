</p><p>Chlorosulphonated Polyethylene (CSM) is a synthetic rubber produced by the chlorosulphonation of polyethylene. It offers excellent resistance to ozone, weathering, heat, and chemicals, making it suitable for various industrial applications.</p><p>
</p><p></p><p>
</p><p>The global Chlorosulphonated Polyethylene (CSM) market is experiencing steady growth, driven by increasing demand in automotive, construction, and industrial sectors. In 2023,  the automotive industry accounting for 40% of demand. The wire and cable insulation segment is the fastest-growing at 5.8% annually. Key trends include a 15% increase in demand for CSM in roofing membranes in 2023, reflecting its superior weathering resistance and durability. Automotive hoses and seals remain the dominant application with a 35% market share, but industrial protective coatings are growing at 6.2% annually due to CSM's excellent chemical resistance. The market is witnessing a 20% surge in R&amp;D investments for developing eco-friendly CSM grades with reduced chlorine content, focusing on meeting stringent environmental regulations. </p><p>
</p><p>Asia Pacific leads with a 45% market share, driven by rapid industrialization and automotive production in countries like China and India. Europe is the fastest-growing region at 5.3% CAGR, fueled by increasing adoption in high-performance automotive components and sustainable construction materials. The industry is also seeing a 25% increase in the development of CSM blends with other elastomers to enhance specific properties for niche applications. </p><p>
</p><p></p><p>
</p><p>In terms of key players, Tosoh Corporation holds the largest market share at 28%, followed by Sundow Polymers at 22% and Hangzhou Keli Chemical at 15%. The market is moderately concentrated, with the top five players accounting for approximately 75% of the global market share. Technological advancements in CSM production processes have led to a 10% improvement in energy efficiency over the past three years, contributing to cost reduction and environmental sustainability efforts in the industry.</p><p>
</p><p></p><p>
</p><p>Chlorosulphonated polyethylene or chlorosulfonated polyethylene (CSM) is a kind of white or light color elastomer which is charactered by its own unique properties as well as the same characteristics as the raw rubber. In aromatic and chlorine hydrocarbons, it can be soluble, but in ketones and ether, it can be only swelling, not soluble.</p><p>
The chemical structure bond of CSM is completely saturated, so the vulcanizate has excellent properties, such as ozone resistance, weather and aging resistance, chemiacal resistance, ionizing radiation resistance, colorability, good physical and mechanical properties, thermal aging resistance, heat and low temperature resistance, flame retardancy, abrasion resistanceand wonderful electric insulation, etc.</p><p>
In production side, currently there only three companies manufacture Chlorosulphonated Polyethylene (CSM) in China, Jilin Petrochemical, Jiangxi Hongrun Chemical Co., Ltd, and Weifang Polygrand Chemical.</p><p>
In consumption of CSM, in China market, Tosoh plays an important role, especially in the high-end market, with a share over 55 percent in 2019 in value.</p><p>
