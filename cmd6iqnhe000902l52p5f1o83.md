# Global Biological Method Acrylamide Market Research Report 2025-2032

<p>The Global Biological Method Acrylamide Market was valued at <strong>US$ 318 million in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>US$ 524 million by 2032</strong>, exhibiting a <strong>Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 6.4%</strong> during the forecast period (2025–2032). This growth trajectory is supported by increasing demand from key end-use industries such as water treatment, pulp and paper, and oil and gas. The market has demonstrated steady expansion over the past decade, driven by technological advancements in biological acrylamide production methods, which offer environmental benefits over traditional chemical synthesis. The Asia-Pacific region, particularly China and Japan, has emerged as a dominant production and consumption hub, contributing significantly to the overall market expansion. North America and Europe also remain critical markets due to stringent environmental regulation favoring bio-based acrylamide.</p><p>
</p><p>The <strong>Global Biological Method Acrylamide Market</strong> refers to the industry focused on the production and distribution of acrylamide derived through biological processes, primarily using enzymes such as nitrile hydratase. Unlike conventional chemical synthesis, biological methods offer a more sustainable and eco-friendly approach, reducing harmful byproducts and energy consumption. Acrylamide is a key chemical intermediate used in the production of polyacrylamide, which finds extensive application in water treatment, enhanced oil recovery, and paper manufacturing. The biological method segment is gaining traction due to regulatory pressure and corporate sustainability initiatives. Key product forms include <strong>acrylamide solution</strong> and <strong>acrylamide crystal</strong>, each catering to specific industrial requirements. The market is characterized by continuous R&amp;D efforts to enhance production efficiency and expand application scope.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

Regional Analysis</p><p>
</p><p><strong>North America:</strong> The North American market is driven by stringent environmental regulation and high adoption of bio-based chemicals in water treatment and oilfield applications. The U.S. and Canada are major consumers, with robust demand from the shale gas sector. The region also benefits from advanced manufacturing infrastructure and strong R&amp;D capability.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Europe:</strong> Europe emphasizes sustainable chemical production, with Germany and France leading in biological acrylamide adoption. The pulp and paper industry is a significant end-user, alongside wastewater treatment plants. The EU’s Green Deal policies further accelerate market growth by promoting bio-based alternatives.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Asia-Pacific:</strong> This region dominates global production and consumption, with China, Japan, and South Korea as key players. Rapid industrialization, coupled with increasing investment in water infrastructure, fuels demand. Local manufacturers like Anhui JuCheng Fine Chemical and Beijing Hengju Chemical Group are expanding capacity to meet regional and export needs.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Latin America:</strong> Brazil and Mexico are emerging markets, driven by mining and oil &amp; gas activity. However, infrastructure challenges and slower regulatory adoption limit growth compared to other regions.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Middle East &amp; Africa:</strong> The market is nascent but growing, particularly in GCC countries, where water scarcity issues drive demand for acrylamide-based flocculants in desalination plants.</p><p>
End User Industry Analysis</p><p>
</p><p>The <strong>water treatment industry</strong> is the largest consumer of biological acrylamide, accounting for over 35% of global demand. Polyacrylamide-based flocculants are essential for municipal and industrial wastewater treatment, particularly in regions facing water scarcity. The <strong>oil and gas industry</strong> follows closely, utilizing acrylamide for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and drilling fluids. With global EOR investment projected to exceed US$ 20 billion annually by 2030, this segment will remain a critical growth driver.</p><p>
</p><p>The <strong>pulp and paper industry</strong> relies on acrylamide as a retention aid and strength enhancer, especially in Asia-Pacific and Europe. Meanwhile, the <strong>mining sector</strong> uses it for tailings management and mineral processing. Emerging applications in <strong>paint and coating</strong> are gaining traction, as bio-based acrylamide improves product sustainability profiles. Other niche applications include adhesives and cosmetics, though these collectively represent less than 10% of the market.</p><p>

Market Dynamics</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Driver:</strong> The shift toward sustainable chemical production is the primary growth driver, with biological acrylamide reducing carbon footprint by up to 30% compared to conventional methods. Regulatory mandates, such as REACH in Europe and EPA guidelines in the U.S., further propel adoption. The water treatment sector’s expansion, particularly in emerging economies, adds momentum, with global wastewater treatment investment exceeding US$ 50 billion annually.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Restraint:</strong> High production cost of biological acrylamide remains a barrier, with bio-based variants priced 15–20% higher than synthetic alternatives. Limited enzyme efficiency and scalability challenges also hinder mass adoption. Additionally, fluctuating acrylonitrile price (a key raw material) impacts profit margin for manufacturers.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Opportunity:</strong> Advancements in enzyme engineering and fermentation technology promise to lower production cost by 2028. Untapped markets in Africa and Latin America offer growth potential, especially for water treatment applications. Collaboration between chemical giants and biotech firms (e.g., BASF’s partnership with Novozymes) is accelerating innovation.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Stringent handling requirements due to acrylamide’s neurotoxicity pose operational hurdles. Competition from alternative flocculants, such as chitosan-based products, threatens market share. Geopolitical tension disrupting acrylonitrile supply chain also presents risk.</p><p>
