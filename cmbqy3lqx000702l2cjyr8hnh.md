The market expansion is driven by rising demand in residential and commercial sectors, infrastructure development, and the aesthetic appeal of granite in high-end architectural designs.</p><p>
</p><p>Granite Tile refers to a form of natural stone tile derived from solid granite rock, a type of igneous rock formed under the Earth's surface through the slow crystallization of magma. Composed mainly of quartz, feldspar, mica, and other trace minerals, granite is one of the hardest and most durable natural materials. As a result, granite tiles are widely known for their high compressive strength, exceptional abrasion resistance, and durability. In addition to these mechanical benefits, granite tiles possess properties such as water resistance, fireproof capabilities, and resistance to acids and alkalis. These characteristics make them suitable for use in high-traffic commercial buildings, exterior paving, monuments, and residential applications such as countertops and flooring.</p><p>
