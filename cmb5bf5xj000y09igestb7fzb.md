# Amorphous Alloys Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Amorphous alloys, also known as metallic glasses or glassy metals, are solid metallic materials characterized by a disordered atomic-scale structure. Unlike conventional crystalline metals, where atoms are arranged in a regular pattern, amorphous alloys exhibit a random atomic arrangement, leading to unique mechanical, electrical, and magnetic properties. These materials are widely used in industries such as automotive, electronics, and energy due to their superior strength, corrosion resistance, and high efficiency in electrical applications.</p><p>
