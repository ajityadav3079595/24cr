# Titanium Sponge Powder Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>In the manufacturing process for titanium sponge, pure titanium tetrachloride is reacted in a stainless steel reactor with magnesium metal heated to 900°C. The titanium tetrachloride is reduced by the magnesium to produce the sponge. Magnesium chloride is extracted at regular intervals during the reaction by the application of pressure. After the reaction has completed, the magnesium chloride and magnesium included in the lump of titanium sponge are eliminated by high-temperature vacuum extraction (vacuum separation process) to leave the titanium sponge.</p><p>
