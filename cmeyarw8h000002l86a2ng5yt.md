<strong>MARKET CHALLENGES</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>High Production Costs and Complex Manufacturing Processes Limit Market Penetration</strong></p><p>
</p><p>While polyimide prepreg offers superior performance characteristics, its high manufacturing cost presents a significant barrier to broader adoption. The specialized production processes and stringent quality control requirements substantially increase the final product cost compared to conventional composites. Raw material costs for polyimide resins remain 30-40% higher than standard epoxy alternatives, making cost-conscious industries hesitant to transition. Smaller manufacturers often find it difficult to justify the premium pricing, particularly in price-sensitive applications.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Other Challenges</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Limited Processing Window</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The narrow processing parameters of polyimide prepreg require precise temperature and pressure controls during curing. This technical complexity increases production risks and requires substantial operator expertise, adding to manufacturing costs.</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Storage and Handling Requirements</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Polyimide prepregs demand strict cold storage conditions and have limited shelf lives compared to other composite materials. These logistical challenges increase operational costs for fabricators and limit supply chain flexibility.</p><p>
<strong>MARKET RESTRAINTS</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Material Alternatives and Substitution Threats Impact Market Potential</strong></p><p>
