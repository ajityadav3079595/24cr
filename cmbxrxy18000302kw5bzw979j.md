</p><p>Historically, the Mo-99 market has faced fluctuations due to supply chain disruptions and the shutdown of aging nuclear reactors. However, recent investments in new production facilities and innovations in LEU-based production methods are stabilizing the market.</p><p>
</p><p>Technological advancements in radiopharmaceutical manufacturing and governmental initiatives to localize production have also enhanced market resilience. Moreover, partnerships among nuclear research organizations are helping to secure a stable supply of Mo-99 for critical healthcare applications.</p><p>
</p><p>Molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) is a vital radioactive isotope extensively used in the field of nuclear medicine. It is the parent isotope of Technetium-99m (Tc-99m), which is the most widely used radioisotope in diagnostic imaging globally. With a half-life of approximately 66 hours, Mo-99 undergoes beta decay to produce Tc-99m, which is then utilized in single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging procedures to examine various body organs such as the brain, heart, bones, and kidneys. Due to the short half-life of Tc-99m, Mo-99 is indispensable for continuous medical imaging applications.</p><p>
</p><p>Mo-99 is primarily produced in nuclear reactors through the irradiation of uranium targets. Two methods dominate this process: using highly enriched uranium (HEU) or low enriched uranium (LEU). However, global initiatives aim to shift towards LEU-based production due to non-proliferation concerns. After irradiation, the Mo-99 is chemically separated and distributed to medical facilities where Tc-99m generators are used.</p><p>
</p><p>In modern healthcare, over 40 million imaging procedures rely on Tc-99m annually, emphasizing the essential role Mo-99 plays in medical diagnostics. Thus, the Mo-99 market forms a critical backbone of nuclear medicine and radiopharmaceutical industries.</p><p>
