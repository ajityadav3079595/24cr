</p><p>This robust growth is attributed to the rising demand for MLCCs in electronics, especially smartphones, electric vehicles (EVs), and IoT devices, which require miniaturized, high-capacitance components.</p><p>
</p><p>The increasing penetration of 5G technology and the global transition towards cleaner energy vehicles have further driven the demand for compact and reliable electronic components. With MLCCs becoming more multilayered and miniaturized, the need for ultrafine, high-purity nickel powder has grown significantly. Additionally, supply chain advancements and technological innovations in powder manufacturing have enabled better scalability and cost efficiency.</p><p>
</p><p>Ultrafine nickel powder for MLCC (Multilayer Ceramic Capacitor) electrodes refers to high-purity, submicron-sized nickel particles that serve as the primary conductive material in the internal electrodes of MLCCs. These powders typically range from 100-400 nanometers and are produced through advanced physical vapor deposition (PVD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes. Their ultrafine size, controlled morphology, and surface properties make them suitable for the high-density layer structures required in modern MLCCs used in electronics, automotive, telecommunications, and other high-frequency applications.</p><p>
</p><p>The production of ultrafine nickel powder involves the transformation of nickel ore—primarily sourced from Indonesia and the Philippines—into a metallic form, followed by a precipitation or vapor deposition process to create uniform nanopowders. These powders are then converted into pastes or inks for screen printing onto ceramic substrates during MLCC fabrication. Given their critical function in capacitor performance, these powders must meet rigorous standards of purity, particle size distribution, and oxidation resistance.</p><p>
