</p><p>The increasing adoption of AIBN as a safer and more consistent alternative to peroxide-based initiators further contributes to its growing market value. In particular, the demand from Asia-Pacific countries, particularly China and India, has significantly bolstered consumption levels due to the rise in local polymer manufacturing and R&amp;D activities. North America and Europe also continue to demonstrate stable demand, driven by technological innovation and sustainability trends within the chemical processing sector.</p><p>
</p><p>Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) is a white crystalline compound widely recognized as a chemical initiator in free-radical polymerization processes. AIBN's core mechanism lies in its ability to thermally decompose into nitrogen gas and free radicals. This decomposition occurs at temperatures around 60–70°C and is integral in initiating polymer chains in the synthesis of various plastics, rubbers, and synthetic fibers. Chemically represented by the formula [(CH3)2C(CN)]2N2, AIBN is soluble in organic solvents and is valued for its relative stability under controlled storage conditions.</p><p>
</p><p>Beyond polymerization, AIBN is used in research laboratories and the chemical industry to support the synthesis of new materials, coatings, and dyes. Its versatility, stability, and efficiency in radical formation make it indispensable in industrial chemistry, particularly in the production of acrylate-based materials and foamed plastics.</p><p>
