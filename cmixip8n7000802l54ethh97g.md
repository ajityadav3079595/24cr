# Global Biodegradable Chelating Agents Market Research Report 2025-2032

<p>The global biodegradable chelating agents market was valued at <strong>US$ 893 million in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>US$ 1.65 billion by 2032</strong>, exhibiting a <strong>Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 8%</strong> during the forecast period (2025–2032). This growth trajectory is driven by increasing environmental regulations, rising demand for sustainable chemical solutions, and expanding applications across multiple industries. The market has demonstrated steady expansion over the past decade, with accelerated adoption in water treatment, pulp &amp; paper, and cleaning applications. The shift from traditional chelating agents to biodegradable alternatives is a key factor propelling this market forward, supported by technological advancements in production processes and material innovation.</p><p>
</p><p>The <strong>Global Biodegradable Chelating Agents Market</strong> comprises chemical compounds that bind metal ions to form stable, water-soluble complexes, while being environmentally friendly and capable of breaking down naturally. Unlike conventional chelating agents like EDTA, which persist in the environment, biodegradable variants such as <strong>GLDA (Glutamic Acid Diacetic Acid)</strong> and <strong>MGDA (Methylglycinediacetic Acid)</strong> decompose without leaving harmful residues. These agents are widely used in industries requiring metal ion control, including water treatment, detergents, agriculture, and personal care. Their ability to enhance process efficiency while meeting stringent environmental standards makes them increasingly indispensable in modern industrial applications.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
