# United States Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) Market Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p><strong>Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs)</strong> are synthetic organic chemicals that were widely used in industrial and commercial applications due to their chemical stability, non-flammability, and insulating properties. Commonly found in electrical equipment like transformers and capacitors, PCBs were banned in the United States in 1979 under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) due to their environmental persistence and potential health hazards. Today, the United States PCB market focuses predominantly on remediation, disposal, and environmental cleanup efforts, given their classification as persistent organic pollutants (POPs)</p><p>
