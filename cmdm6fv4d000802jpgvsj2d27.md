</p><p>This impressive growth trajectory is driven by the global emphasis on renewable energy sources and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Historically, the market has seen steady growth, particularly in regions with strong renewable energy policies such as the European Union and North America. The market's expansion is further supported by the increasing adoption of biomass in thermal power plants and industrial boilers, as well as governmental incentives for clean energy projects.</p><p>
</p><p>Torrefied pellets are a form of bioenergy fuel derived from biomass through a process called torrefaction, which involves heating biomass at temperatures typically between 200°C and 320°C in an oxygen-deprived environment. This thermal treatment drives off moisture and volatile compounds, resulting in a dry, brittle, and hydrophobic product with high energy density. Torrefied pellets are superior to traditional wood pellets in combustion efficiency, water resistance, and grindability. They are primarily used in power generation as a sustainable and renewable alternative to coal, particularly in co-firing applications.</p><p>
<strong>Market Dynamics (Drivers, Restraints, Opportunities, and Challenges)</strong></p><p>
