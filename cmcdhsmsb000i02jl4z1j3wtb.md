Additionally, the push for fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly vehicles has led manufacturers to adopt materials like HBR, known for its excellent air retention and durability. </p><p>
</p><p>Halogenated butyl rubber is a synthetic elastomer derived from the halogenation of butyl rubber with chlorine (chlorobutyl) or bromine (bromobutyl). This modification enhances the rubber's impermeability to gases, resistance to heat, and compatibility with other rubbers, making it ideal for tire inner liners and sidewalls. Its superior properties contribute to improved tire performance, longevity, and safety. </p><p>
