</p><p>Hydroxyl Silicone Oil, also known as hydroxy-terminated silicone oil or silanol-terminated silicone oil, is a type of linear polysiloxane polymer characterized by hydroxyl (-OH) functional groups at the end of its molecular chains. These hydroxyl groups provide reactivity, allowing the polymer to undergo further chemical reactions such as cross-linking or condensation. As a result, hydroxyl silicone oil serves as a fundamental building block in a variety of industries, particularly where strong adhesion, film formation, and surface modification are essential.</p><p>
</p><p>The material typically features high thermal stability, excellent dielectric properties, and outstanding water repellency, making it invaluable in sectors such as personal care, construction, electronics, and industrial coatings. It acts as a vital intermediate in the production of silicone rubber, resins, and fluids, and is often utilized as a base material for the synthesis of high-performance materials.</p><p>
