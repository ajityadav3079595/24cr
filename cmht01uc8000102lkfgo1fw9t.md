# Biogas Separation Membrane Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030

<p>The global Biogas Separation Membrane market was valued at US$ million in 2023 and is projected to reach US$ million by 2030, at a CAGR of % during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.
Biogas Separation Membrane uses the different selective permeability of different gases to the permeable membrane, and can simultaneously separate CH4, CO2, and H2S, that is, CO2 and H2S cannot pass through the permeable membrane under pressurized conditions, but CH4 can pass through, thereby separating CH4 Separation from other polluting gases to purify biogas. The application of biogas separation membrane in biogas purification has the following advantages: methane escape (loss) during the purification process is 1000Nm3/h); can start and stop the operation of equipment in a short time interval, A high degree of flexibility is ensured; direct input (via the gas pipeline) into the gas supply network is possible without additional compressors.In terms of product type, type &gt;99% methane recovery rate is the largest segment, occupied for a share of 62.86%, and in terms of application, application commercial factory biogas digester has a share about 85.61 percent.
