# Global Industrial Grade Dimethyl Carbonate Market Research Report 2025-2032

<p>The global industrial grade dimethyl carbonate market was valued at <strong>US$ 495.7 million</strong> in 2024 and is projected to reach <strong>US$ 925.5 million</strong> by 2032, exhibiting a <strong>Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7.8%</strong> during the forecast period (2025–2032). The market growth is driven by increasing demand from end-use industries such as polycarbonates, paints and coatings, adhesives, and other applications. The market has shown steady growth over the past decade, with significant expansion in the Asia-Pacific region due to rapid industrialization and urbanization.</p><p>
</p><p>Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) is an organic compound with the formula (CH3O)2CO. It is a colorless, flammable liquid with a mild odor, widely used as a solvent, methylating agent, and intermediate in chemical synthesis. Industrial-grade DMC is primarily utilized in the production of polycarbonates, paints, coatings, adhesives, and other industrial applications. It is considered an environmentally friendly alternative to toxic solvents like methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) and toluene, making it increasingly popular in green chemistry applications.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
