# Global 2-Nitroaniline Market Research Report 2025-2032

<p>The global 2-Nitroaniline market was valued at <strong>US$ 135 million in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>US$ 197 million by 2032</strong>, exhibiting a <strong>Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 0.048%</strong> during the forecast period (2025–2032). The steady growth is attributed to increasing demand from dye and pigment industries, as well as pharmaceutical and agrochemical intermediate applications. The market has historically shown consistent growth due to its critical role in specialty chemicals and UV absorbers, with Asia-Pacific leading both production and consumption. Future projections indicate sustained demand, particularly from emerging economies where industrial and chemical manufacturing sectors are expanding rapidly.</p><p>
</p><p>2-Nitroaniline is an organic compound primarily used as an intermediate in the synthesis of dyes, pigments, and agrochemicals. It is a yellow crystalline solid with the chemical formula C6H6N2O2 and is classified as a nitroaromatic compound. The compound plays a pivotal role in manufacturing azo dyes, which are widely utilized in textiles, inks, and plastics. Additionally, it serves as a precursor in pharmaceutical production and UV absorber formulations. The market is segmented by purity levels (≥99.5% and 98% to ≤99.5%) to cater to diverse industrial requirements. Due to its hazardous nature, stringent regulations govern its production, storage, and transportation, influencing market dynamics.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
