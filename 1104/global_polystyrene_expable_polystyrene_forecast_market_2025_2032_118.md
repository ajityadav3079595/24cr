<h1>Polystyrene and Expandable Polystyrene (EPS) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Polystyrene (PS) and Expandable Polystyrene (EPS) are synthetic polymers derived from styrene monomers through free-radical addition polymerization. Polystyrene is a rigid, colorless thermoplastic with a glass transition temperature exceeding 100Â°C. This characteristic allows it to be widely used in applications that require thermal resistance, such as disposable food containers. Expandable Polystyrene (EPS) is a lightweight, foam-like material known for its excellent insulation properties and shock-absorbing capabilities, making it a preferred choice in packaging, construction, and consumer goods industries.</p><p>
