The sputtering target used for magnetic materials is used for the sputtering process, which is a technology commonly used for thin film deposition. The sputtering process involves bombarding the target material with high-energy particles (such as ions) in the vacuum chamber. This will cause atoms or molecules to eject from the target and deposit on the substrate, forming a thin film. In the case of magnetic materials, the sputtering target is usually made of magnetic materials to be deposited on the substrate. According to the specific application requirements, the target material can be pure metal, alloy or compound.</p><p>
