# Synthetic and Felt Roof Underlayment Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Roofing underlayment refers to the protective layer installed directly on the roof deck, acting as a barrier between the shingles and the sheathing. It is an essential component of the roofing system, offering a secondary line of defense against environmental elements such as rain, snow, and wind. The two primary types of roofing underlayment are <strong style="font-size:13px">synthetic underlayment</strong> and <strong style="font-size:13px">felt underlayment</strong>, each with unique characteristics that cater to different roofing requirements.</p><p>
</p><p>Synthetic underlayment, made from polyethylene or polypropylene, is known for its durability, lightweight nature, and resistance to moisture. Felt underlayment, typically composed of asphalt-saturated paper or fiberglass, has been a traditional choice in the industry due to its affordability and ease of installation.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
