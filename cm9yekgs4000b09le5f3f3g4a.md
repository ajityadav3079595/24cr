# Gadolinium Acetylacetonate Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Gadolinium acetylacetonate is a compound with the chemical formula Gd (c5h7o2) 3. It decomposes into Gd2O3 under strong heat. It is used as a reagent in laboratories to provide a gadolinium source and can be mixed with acetyl acetone cerium to prepare Gadolinium-Doped Ceria (GDC) gel powder. It should be sealed and stored dry.</p><p>
