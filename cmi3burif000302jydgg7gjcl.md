</p><p>Tungsten Copper (WCu) alloys are advanced metal matrix composites combining tungsten and copper. While not true alloys due to their immiscibility, these materials leverage tungsten's high melting point (3,422Â°C) and copper's thermal conductivity (401 W/mÂ·K) for extreme environment applications. The microstructure consists of tungsten particles dispersed in a copper matrix, delivering unique properties including ablation resistance, electrical conductivity (20-50% IACS), and thermal expansion coefficients matching semiconductor materials (5.5-8.5 Ã— 10-6/K).</p><p>
</p><p>Market growth is primarily driven by expanding applications in aerospace thermal management systems and semiconductor packaging, where these alloys demonstrate 20-30% better thermal performance than alternatives. However, high material costs (tungsten prices averaging USD 300-350 per MTU in 2024) and complex powder metallurgy processing create adoption barriers. Recent developments include Sumitomo Electric's 2023 launch of nano-structured WCu70/30 composites with 15% enhanced conductivity for 5G base station heat sinks, indicating ongoing material innovation addressing performance limitations.</p><p>
