# Microsilica Powder Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Microsilica powder, also known as silica fume, is an ultrafine, high-performance mineral additive primarily composed of amorphous silicon dioxide. It is a byproduct of the production of silicon and ferrosilicon alloys in electric arc furnaces. Due to its extremely small particle size and high pozzolanic activity, microsilica powder is widely used in concrete production to enhance its strength, durability, and resistance to chemical attack. It is also utilized in refractory materials, oil well cementing, and polymer applications.</p><p>
