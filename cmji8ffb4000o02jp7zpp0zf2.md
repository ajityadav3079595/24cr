<strong>MARKET CHALLENGES</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Strain Stability and Viability Remain Persistent Technical Hurdles</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Despite technological improvements, maintaining microbial viability through manufacturing and distribution remains challenging. Temperature fluctuations during storage can reduce efficacy by 50-80%, while gastric acidity destroys many unprotected strains before reaching the intestines. Current encapsulation technologies add 15-25% to production costs while still failing to fully address these issues. These limitations particularly impact products targeting specific intestinal regions where controlled release is critical for therapeutic effect.</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Intellectual Property Constraints Limit Innovation Protection</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The natural origin of most probiotic strains creates unique IP challenges. Unlike synthetic compounds, naturally occurring microorganisms often cannot be patented, leading to rapid commoditization of successful strains. This dynamic forces companies to rely on formulation patents and proprietary manufacturing processes, which offer weaker protection. Consequently, the average time before strain-specific product margins erode has decreased from 36 months in 2015 to just 18 months currently, putting pressure on ROI timelines.</p><p>
