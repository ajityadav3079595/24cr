# Linear Alkylbenzene (LAB) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032: Supply and Demand analysis, Regional Analysis and Competitive

<p><strong>Linear Alkylbenzene (LAB)</strong> is a key organic compound predominantly used in the production of detergents and cleaning products. It is synthesized through the alkylation of benzene with normal paraffins, which are derived from kerosene. LAB serves as a precursor to Linear Alkylbenzene Sulfonate (LAS), a widely used surfactant known for its exceptional cleaning properties. LAS constitutes the active ingredient in many household, industrial, and commercial detergents, owing to its ability to reduce water surface tension, enhance stain removal, and disperse contaminants effectively.</p><p>
