</p><p>Historical data indicate a steady expansion in the market since 2018, driven by the increasing usage of engineering plastics in the automotive and construction sectors. In recent years, stringent regulations regarding polymer degradation and sustainability have further catalyzed market demand. The growing application of polyurethane foams in insulation and the rising use of POM in precision parts for electronics and consumer goods have particularly contributed to the market expansion.</p><p>
</p><p>Emerging markets are playing a significant role in driving demand. Countries like China, India, and Brazil are seeing increased investments in manufacturing and infrastructure, which directly influences the uptake of Antioxidant 245 in polymers used for construction, packaging, and electronics.</p><p>
</p><p>Antioxidant 245, chemically known as tris(4-tert-butyl-3-hydroxy-2,6-dimethylbenzyl)isocyanurate (CAS No. 36443-68-2), is a high-performance, sterically hindered phenolic antioxidant. It is primarily used to inhibit the oxidative degradation of polymers and elastomers during processing and end-use. This compound is particularly valued in materials that are exposed to heat, oxygen, or ultraviolet radiation, as it imparts excellent thermal stability and long-term aging protection. Antioxidant 245 is non-discoloring and compatible with a wide range of polymer resins, including polyurethane, POM (polyoxymethylene), and polyamide, making it a preferred choice in industries such as plastics, rubber, coatings, adhesives, and automotive.</p><p>
</p><p>Its molecular structure provides effective stabilization against free radicals and oxidative breakdown, thereby enhancing the durability and mechanical properties of the end products. As sustainability and product longevity become key concerns in materials engineering and manufacturing, the use of Antioxidant 245 is gaining traction globally.</p><p>
