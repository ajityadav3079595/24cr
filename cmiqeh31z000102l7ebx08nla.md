# Polypropylene Oxide Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Polypropylene Oxide is a polymer derived from propylene glycol and classified as a polyether. The term "Polypropylene Glycol" (PPG) is designated for low to medium molar mass polymers where the end-group functionality remains significant. Conversely, the term "oxide" is applied to high molar mass polymers, where the influence of end-groups on polymer properties diminishes.</p><p>
