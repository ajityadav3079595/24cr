# Global Sodium Thiosulphate Pentahydrate Market Research Report 2025-2032

<p>The global sodium thiosulphate pentahydrate market was valued at <strong>US$ 213 million in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>US$ 309 million by 2032</strong>, exhibiting a <strong>Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 4.8%</strong> during the forecast period (2025–2032). The market growth is driven by increasing demand from various end-use industries such as photography, electroplating, and water treatment. The market has shown steady growth historically, with significant contributions from the Asia-Pacific region, particularly China and India, due to rapid industrialization and urbanization.</p><p>
</p><p>Sodium thiosulphate pentahydrate (Na2S2O3·5H2O) is a white crystalline compound widely used as a reducing agent, dechlorination agent, and photographic fixer. It is highly soluble in water and has applications in industries such as photography, electroplating, leather processing, and water treatment. The compound is known for its ability to neutralize chlorine, making it essential in wastewater treatment and swimming pool maintenance. Its role in photographic fixing solutions, where it removes unexposed silver halides from photographic films and papers, remains a significant application.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
