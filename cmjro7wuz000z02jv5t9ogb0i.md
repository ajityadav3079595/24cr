Furthermore, the home fragrance segment is driving demand for citrus-based essential oil blends, particularly in North America and Europe.</p><p>
<strong>MARKET RESTRAINTS</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Phototoxicity Concerns to Limit Widespread Adoption</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Despite its benefits, citrus limon peel oil faces challenges due to its phototoxic properties caused by furanocoumarins.

This momentum is likely to continue as e-commerce platforms make these natural ingredients more accessible to small-scale formulators and DIY enthusiasts, further expanding the consumer base.</p><p>
<strong>Other Trends</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Growing Application in Food and Beverage Industry</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The expanding use of Citrus Limon Peel Oil in the food and beverage sector is another key trend shaping the market. With consumers demanding clean-label products free from artificial flavors, lemon peel oil serves as a natural alternative for enhancing taste in beverages, confectionery, and baked goods.
