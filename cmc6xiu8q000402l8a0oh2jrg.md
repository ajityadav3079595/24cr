*To further strengthen the sustainability and competitiveness of TDI (toluene diisocyanate) production for the manufacture of flexible foams in Europe, Covestro is investing a mid to high double-digit million euro amount in the modernization of its production plant in Dormagen by 2025. The plant was commissioned in early 2015 and is considered one of the most advanced TDI production facilities in the world due to the use of the gas phase technology developed by Covestro. The work will include the installation of a modern reactor that will enable the reaction energy to be used for energy-efficient steam generation in the future.</p><p>
*Covestro, a global leader in high performance polymers, and Encina, a US-based producer of ISCC PLUS certified circular chemicals, reached a long-term supply agreement for chemically recycled, circular feedstock derived from post-consumer end-of-life plastic. Specifically, Encina will supply Covestro with benzene and toluene pending the completion of Encina's world-scale production facility, anticipated to come online at the end of 2027.</p><p>
