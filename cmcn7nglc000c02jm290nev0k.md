These treatments primarily include stimulant medications (such as amphetamine and methylphenidate-based drugs) and non-stimulant alternatives.</p><p>
</p><p>The market encompasses a wide array of formulations, from long-acting to short-acting medications, tailored to meet the diverse needs of patients across different age groups. Furthermore, ADHD drugs are typically prescribed through various channels including hospitals, outpatient clinics, and pharmacies.
