# Recycled ABS Resins Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Recycled ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) resins are plastic materials derived from recycled ABS waste. This process involves sorting, cleaning, melt extrusion, and compounding waste ABS plastics, which can come from various sources, including post-consumer waste (such as electronic products and end-of-life items) and post-industrial waste. The aim of producing recycled ABS resins is to reduce environmental impact while maintaining material properties suitable for various industrial applications. These resins are primarily used in industries that require durable and high-performance plastics, such as automotive, electronics, packaging, and consumer goods.</p><p>
