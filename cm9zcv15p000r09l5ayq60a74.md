</p><p>Screen-printed electrodes (SPE) are compact, disposable, and low-cost devices that integrate a working electrode, reference electrode, and counter electrode onto a miniaturized platform. These electrodes are fabricated on conductive substrates such as carbon-based materials (e.g., graphite, graphene) and metals (e.g., gold, silver, platinum). SPEs are crucial in electrochemical sensing and analysis, offering portability and ease of use for a wide range of applications, including healthcare diagnostics, environmental monitoring, food quality testing, and industrial processes. Their ability to provide accurate and real-time data while being cost-efficient makes them ideal for widespread adoption in both academic research and industrial applications.</p><p>
