</p><p>This significant growth is driven by increasing investments in renewable energy infrastructure, the global push to decarbonize energy systems, and supportive government policies incentivizing clean hydrogen projects.</p><p>
</p><p>In terms of installed capacity and sales volume, the green hydrogen market is poised to witness exponential growth, with installations measured in megawatts (MW) expected to rise sharply across major economies. Notably, North America held the largest market share of approximately 33% in 2024, followed by China with 25% and Europe with 23%. The rapid expansion of electrolyzer deployment and technological advancements are fostering scalability and cost competitiveness in the green hydrogen industry.</p><p>
</p><p>Market forecasts from 2020 to 2031 highlight a robust increase in global production and consumption, underpinning the market's transformative potential. Leading organizations and government agencies are prioritizing hydrogen as a strategic pillar for energy transition, further reinforcing the sector's long-term growth trajectory.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Green Hydrogen</strong> refers to hydrogen gas that is produced using renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, or hydropower through the process of water electrolysis. Unlike grey or blue hydrogen, green hydrogen emits zero greenhouse gases during production, making it a sustainable alternative for decarbonizing various industrial and transportation sectors. The key component of green hydrogen production is an electrolyzer, which splits water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity sourced entirely from renewable energy. As the global community intensifies efforts to combat climate change and transition toward a low-carbon economy, green hydrogen has emerged as a pivotal solution for achieving net-zero emissions.</p><p>
</p><p>Green hydrogen is gaining traction across sectors such as transportation (especially fuel cell electric vehicles), industrial energy (steel production, ammonia synthesis), and power generation. It serves as both a clean energy carrier and a long-term storage medium, supporting grid stabilization when integrated with variable renewable energy sources. As technology improves and production costs decline, green hydrogen is becoming increasingly viable for widespread adoption.</p><p>
