The vacuum acts as an effective barrier against heat transfer, making VIG one of the most efficient glazing solutions available. VIG panels are particularly suited for applications where superior energy efficiency, noise reduction, and condensation control are required, such as in architectural buildings, residential homes, and high-performance appliances.</p><p>
