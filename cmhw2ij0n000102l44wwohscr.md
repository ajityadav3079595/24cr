<strong>Market Size</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Polyethylene Furanoate (PEF) is a bio-based polymer produced through the polycondensation process, with its fundamental building block being 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). As a sustainable alternative to polyethylene terephthalate (PET), PEF offers superior barrier properties, recyclability, and a reduced carbon footprint. It is primarily used in the packaging industry for manufacturing bottles, films, and fibers, contributing to the global transition toward eco-friendly materials.</p><p>
</p><p></p><p>
<strong>Historical Trends and Growth Projections</strong></p><p>
</p><p>In 2020, the global PEF market was valued at around USD 21 million, indicating a steady increase in demand.</p><p>Between 2024 and 2030, the market is expected to witness a consistent CAGR of 6.60%, fueled by investments in bioplastics research and development.</p><p>The North American PEF market, which stood at USD 7.30 million in 2023, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.66% during the forecast period.</p><p>
