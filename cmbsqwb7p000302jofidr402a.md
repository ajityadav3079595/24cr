</p><p><strong>Over the past decade, the hygiene industry has witnessed a surge in innovation, with elastic film technology playing a pivotal role. As baby boomer populations age and birth rates rise in certain regions, the demand for high-performance hygiene products is accelerating, directly influencing the growth of the elastic film market.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Hygiene elastic films are specialized polymer-based films integrated with elastic properties that allow them to stretch and recover to their original form. These films are engineered by blending elastic materials such as elastomers, spandex, or thermoplastic polyurethanes with polyethylene or polypropylene matrices. The primary function of hygiene elastic films is to provide stretchability and comfort in personal care products, particularly in diapers, adult incontinence products, and feminine hygiene items. These films are pivotal in enhancing the fit and functionality of these products, especially around waistbands, leg cuffs, and ear tabs.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Elastic films used in hygiene applications are characterized by their softness, breathability, and high elasticity. They are typically produced through cast film extrusion or blown film processes and may incorporate micro-perforation or lamination for better performance. These materials also need to meet stringent hygiene and safety standards due to their close contact with the human body.</strong></p><p>
