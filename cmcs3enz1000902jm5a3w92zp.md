</p><p>Heavy Alkyl Benzenes (HAB) are primarily byproducts of the production of linear alkyl benzene (LAB) and branched alkyl benzene (BAB). These compounds are characterized by their low viscosity and yellow, oily texture. The main composition of HAB is dialkyl benzene, which makes it suitable for a variety of applications, particularly in industrial processes.</p><p>
</p><p>One of the key applications of HAB is as an additive in heat transfer oils and lubricating greases, where it enhances the performance and thermal stability of the fluids. Its usage in high-temperature operations across sectors like automotive, power generation, and heavy machinery is crucial due to its excellent thermal conductivity and low volatility.</p><p>
</p><p>Moreover, HAB is used as a base oil in lubricants and conduction oils, making it valuable in applications that demand efficient and stable lubrication under extreme conditions. Its role as a stabilizing agent in heat-sensitive environments further emphasizes its importance in modern industrial processes.</p><p>
