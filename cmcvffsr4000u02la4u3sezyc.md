# Sialic Acid Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Sialic acid is a collective term for derivatives of neuraminic acid, a nine-carbon monosaccharide. It is most commonly represented by N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac or NANA). Found abundantly in animal tissues and more sparsely in plants, fungi, yeasts, and bacteria, sialic acids play essential roles in biological processes. These acids are predominantly present in glycoproteins and gangliosides, impacting cellular signaling, adhesion, and immune response. Swedish biochemist Gunnar Blix introduced the term "sialic acid" in 1952, derived from the Greek word for saliva (<strong>sialon</strong>).</p><p>
</p><p>Sialic acid's versatile chemical structure allows for modifications such as acetylation, lactylation, methylation, sulfation, and phosphorylation, contributing to its diverse biological functions and industrial applications.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
