</p><p>As policy frameworks like the European Green Deal and the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act promote decarbonization, investments in CCU and green methanol infrastructure are accelerating. This growth trajectory is expected to be exponential over the coming decade, making Recycled Carbon Methanol a high-potential segment within the sustainable chemical industry.</p><p>
</p><p>Recycled Carbon Methanol refers to methanol produced through the conversion of captured carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and renewable hydrogen. This process results in a sustainable alternative to conventional fossil-based methanol. As a synthetic alcohol, it serves as a critical building block for various chemical products, fuels, and energy applications. The market for Recycled Carbon Methanol is rooted in carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies that seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by repurposing industrial CO2. It supports circular economy principles and offers a promising route to achieving carbon neutrality across sectors including transportation, power generation, and chemical manufacturing.</p><p>
