# Global Nutshell Activated Carbon Market Research Report 2025-2032

<p>The global nutshell activated carbon market was valued at <strong>US$ 683.5 million in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>US$ 1,064.5 million by 2032</strong>, exhibiting a <strong>Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 5.7%</strong> during the forecast period (2025–2032). The market growth is driven by increasing demand for activated carbon in water purification, air filtration, and industrial applications. The market is segmented by type, application, and region, with coconut shell, peach shell, walnut shell, and date shell being the primary sources of activated carbon.</p><p>
</p><p>Nutshell activated carbon is a highly porous carbon material derived from the carbonization of nutshells, such as coconut, peach, walnut, and date shells. It is widely used for adsorption, purification, and filtration applications due to its high surface area and excellent adsorption properties. The material is commonly employed in <strong>water treatment, air purification, food and beverage processing, and pharmaceutical industries</strong>. The activation process enhances its porosity, making it highly effective in removing impurities, contaminants, and odors from gases and liquids.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
