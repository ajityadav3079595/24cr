</p><p>Historical trends indicate a sharp increase in the adoption of recycled plastics across major food and beverage industries, especially in Europe and North America. In 2020, the global market was valued at approximately USD 120 million, demonstrating that the market has more than doubled in a short span due to innovations in recycling technologies, increasing food-grade certifications, and growing consumer awareness about eco-friendly packaging.</p><p>
</p><p>Market expansion is further facilitated by supportive regulations such as the European Commission's Plastic Strategy and the U.S. FDA’s No Objection Letter (NOL) process, which encourages companies to develop food-safe recycled materials. In Asia-Pacific, rapid industrialization and the emergence of sustainable manufacturing hubs are further contributing to market expansion.</p><p>
</p><p>Food grade recycled polypropylene (PP) refers to recycled PP materials that have been processed to meet rigorous standards for safety in direct food contact applications. Polypropylene, a thermoplastic polymer widely used in packaging, containers, and kitchenware, becomes food grade after undergoing comprehensive recycling processes. These processes include sorting, washing, decontamination, and reprocessing to eliminate contaminants and ensure compliance with food safety regulations, such as those set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).</p><p>
</p><p>This type of recycled PP is sourced from post-consumer or post-industrial waste, such as used food containers or clean production scrap, and is then subjected to advanced purification and extrusion technologies. Food grade recycled PP finds extensive applications in the production of food containers, trays, cups, caps, and other packaging solutions. The increasing global focus on circular economy principles and sustainability has significantly elevated the relevance of food grade recycled PP in recent years.</p><p>
