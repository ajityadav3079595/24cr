# Rice Husk Ash Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Rice husks, or rice hulls, are the hard protective coverings of grains of rice. These husks not only serve as a barrier to protect rice during the growing season but also have a variety of practical uses once the rice is harvested. Rice Husk Ash (RHA) is produced when rice husks are burned in industrial furnaces or boilers. The resulting ash, composed primarily of silica, is a valuable resource in various industries due to its unique properties. Rice Husk Ash has several applications, including in the construction industry as a cement additive, as a source of silica for manufacturing electronics and other products, and in the production of refractory materials.</p><p>
