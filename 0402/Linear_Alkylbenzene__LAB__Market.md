<h1>Linear Alkylbenzene (LAB) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032: Supply and Demand analysis, Regional Analysis and Competitive</h1><br/><p><strong>Linear Alkylbenzene (LAB)</strong> is a key organic compound predominantly used in the production of detergents and cleaning products. It is synthesized through the alkylation of benzene with normal paraffins, which are derived from kerosene. LAB serves as a precursor to Linear Alkylbenzene Sulfonate (LAS), a widely used surfactant known for its exceptional cleaning properties. LAS constitutes the active ingredient in many household, industrial, and commercial detergents, owing to its ability to reduce water surface tension, enhance stain removal, and disperse contaminants effectively.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The <strong>Global Linear Alkylbenzene (LAB) Market</strong> was valued at <strong>USD 4,322.40 million in 2023</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>USD 4,986.18 million by 2032</strong>, exhibiting a <strong><strong>CAGR</strong> of 1.60%</strong> during the forecast period. The <strong>North America LAB Market</strong>, specifically, was valued at <strong>USD 1,157.40 million in 2023</strong> and is expected to grow at a <strong>CAGR</strong> of <strong>1.37%</strong> through 2032. This steady growth can be attributed to increasing demand for household detergents, the rising global population, and growing awareness about hygiene.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><strong>Increasing Demand for Cleaning Products</strong>: With heightened awareness about personal and public hygiene, especially post-COVID-19, the demand for detergents and cleaning agents has surged globally.</p>
