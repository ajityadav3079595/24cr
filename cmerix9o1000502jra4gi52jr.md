# Polybutylene Terephthalate (PBT) Plastic Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Polybutylene Terephthalate (PBT) is a high-performance engineering thermoplastic that belongs to the polyester family. It is known for its excellent mechanical and electrical properties, high chemical resistance, and thermal stability. PBT is widely used in the automotive, electrical, and electronics industries due to its durability, low moisture absorption, and resistance to solvents. This material is often employed in making electrical connectors, precision automotive parts, and various industrial components.</p><p>
