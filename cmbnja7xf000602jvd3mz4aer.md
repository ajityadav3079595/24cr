# Quaternary Ammonium Compounds Market, Global Outlook & Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Quaternary Ammonium Compounds (QACs) are a class of cationic surfactants widely used for their antimicrobial, disinfectant, and surface-active properties. These compounds find applications in various industries, including pharmaceuticals, personal care, textiles, and industrial cleaning. QACs are typically composed of a positively charged nitrogen atom bonded to four organic groups, making them highly effective against bacteria, viruses, and fungi.</p><p>
