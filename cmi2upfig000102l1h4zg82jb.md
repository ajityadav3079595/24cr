# Forgings Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Forging is a manufacturing process involving the shaping of metal using localized compressive forces. The blows are delivered with a hammer (often a power hammer) or a die. Forging is often classified according to the temperature at which it is performed: cold forging, warm forging, or hot forging. Forged parts can range in weight from less than a kilogram to hundreds of metric tons. Since the Industrial Revolution, forged parts are widely used in mechanisms and machines wherever high strength is required.</p><p>
