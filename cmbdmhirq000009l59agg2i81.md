# Global Solvent-free Polyurethane Adhesive Market Research Report 2025-2032

<p>The global solvent-free polyurethane adhesive market was valued at<strong> US$ 2.94 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 4.95 billion by 2032, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 0.067 during the forecast period (2025-2032).</strong> This growth is driven by increasing demand from key end-use industries such as packaging, automotive, and construction. The market has shown consistent growth over the past decade, with technological advancements in adhesive formulations and increasing environmental regulations pushing manufacturers toward solvent-free solutions.</p><p>
</p><p>Solvent-free polyurethane adhesives are high-performance bonding agents that do not contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or solvents in their formulation. These adhesives are primarily composed of polyurethane polymers that cure through chemical reactions, typically moisture curing or heat curing mechanisms. They offer superior bonding strength, flexibility, and durability compared to traditional solvent-based adhesives. The key product types include monocomponent and bi-component systems, which find applications across various industries due to their excellent adhesion to diverse substrates, resistance to environmental factors, and compliance with stringent environmental regulations.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
