This regional growth is driven by government subsidies, expanding green hydrogen infrastructure, and increasing investments in carbon capture technologies.</p><p>
</p><p>Green methanol is a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy source produced through the synthesis of green hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The hydrogen used is derived from renewable energy sources such as solar and wind through water electrolysis, while carbon dioxide is sourced either from biomass or captured directly from industrial emissions or the atmosphere. This synthesis occurs under catalytic conditions, emphasizing the importance of specialized catalysts in the process. Green methanol serves as a viable alternative to conventional fossil fuels, contributing significantly to global carbon neutrality goals.</p><p>
