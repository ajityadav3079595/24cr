</p><p>Glucose, often referred to as dextrose in its crystalline form, is a simple sugar and the most abundant monosaccharide. It is a vital carbohydrate that serves as the primary source of energy for most living organisms. Glucose is produced naturally by plants and algae during the process of photosynthesis, where carbon dioxide and water are converted into glucose using energy from sunlight.</p><p>
</p><p>In commercial applications, glucose is extracted from starch and used as a sweetener in a wide range of food and beverages. It also has applications in the pharmaceutical industry as an intravenous solution for rehydration and as a component in various pharmaceutical formulations. Glucose is classified into different forms such as D-glucose monohydrate and anhydrous glucose, based on its water content. The product is vital in the production of syrups, energy drinks, and as a fermentation agent in the production of alcoholic beverages and biofuels.</p><p>
