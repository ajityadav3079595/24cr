</p><p>Fuel stabilizer, such as gasoline stabilizer, is crucial for preserving the quality of gasoline, especially when containing ethanol like E10 or E15, in vehicles that are stored for extended periods. Dry gas, another additive, prevents water in the tank or fuel lines from freezing. Gasoline stabilizer eliminates the need to drain fuel before storage by keeping it fresh for up to 24 months, preventing engine issues like gum and varnish build-up.</p><p>
</p><p>The global Gasoline Stabilizer market was valued at USD 710 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 959.28 million by 2032, with a CAGR of 3.40% during the forecast period. In North America, the market size was estimated at USD 195.95 million in 2023, growing at a CAGR of 2.91% from 2025 to 2032.</p><p>
