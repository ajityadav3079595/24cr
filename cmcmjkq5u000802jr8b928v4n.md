</p><p>This growth is driven by rising consumer awareness regarding the health hazards of synthetic pesticides and the increasing popularity of organic farming and gardening practices. Historical data from 2018 to 2023 indicates a steady year-on-year growth in both volume and value. North America and Europe continue to lead the market due to stringent regulatory frameworks and higher consumer preference for eco-friendly products. Meanwhile, markets in Asia-Pacific and Latin America are emerging as high-potential regions owing to increasing urbanization and a growing middle class demanding safer home and garden solutions.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Natural Insecticides for Home and Garden</strong> refer to pest control products derived from natural sources such as plants, minerals, and microorganisms. Unlike synthetic chemical pesticides, natural insecticides typically feature ingredients like neem oil, pyrethrin, citrus oil, or diatomaceous earth. These substances are used to control or repel insects in residential settings, including gardens, lawns, and indoor environments. Natural insecticides are preferred by environmentally conscious consumers due to their biodegradability, lower toxicity to humans and pets, and minimal environmental impact. They are available in various formulations, such as sprays, liquids, and powders, and are distributed through supermarkets, pharmacies, department stores, and online platforms. The growing shift towards sustainable and organic gardening practices has significantly increased the adoption of natural insecticides.<strong>Market Dynamics (Drivers, Restraints, Opportunities, and Challenges)</strong></p><p>
