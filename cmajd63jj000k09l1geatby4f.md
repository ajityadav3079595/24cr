# Global GLDA Market Research Report 2025-2032

<p>The Global GLDA (Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate) market was valued at <strong>US$ 186 million in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach <strong>US$ 312 million by 2032</strong>, exhibiting a robust <strong>Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 6.7%</strong> during the forecast period (2025–2032). This growth trajectory is supported by increasing demand across multiple industries, including detergents, personal care, and agricultural chemicals. The market has shown consistent expansion over the past decade, driven by the shift toward eco-friendly chelating agents and stringent environmental regulations promoting sustainable alternatives to traditional phosphates and EDTA. The Asia-Pacific region, particularly China and India, has emerged as a significant contributor to market growth due to rapid industrialization and rising consumer awareness about sustainable products.</p><p>
</p><p>The <strong>Global GLDA Market</strong> refers to the worldwide industry centered around Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, a biodegradable chelating agent derived from natural raw materials such as glutamic acid. GLDA is widely recognized for its superior chelation properties, making it an effective alternative to conventional phosphates and EDTA in various applications. It is primarily available in two forms: <strong>liquid and solid</strong>. The liquid form is preferred for industrial applications due to its ease of handling, while the solid form is commonly used in consumer products like detergents and personal care items. GLDA's biodegradability and low toxicity have positioned it as a sustainable solution in industries striving to meet environmental compliance standards. Its versatility extends to applications in pulp and paper manufacturing, agricultural chemicals, and food processing, where it acts as a stabilizer and preservative.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
