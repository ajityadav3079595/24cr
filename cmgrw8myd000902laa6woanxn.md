<strong>MARKET CHALLENGES</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Technical Limitations in High-Dose Formulations to Constrain Applications</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Although HPMC serves as an excellent excipient for many oral formulations, it presents challenges in high-dose drug delivery systems. Concentrations above 10% often lead to undesirable viscosity levels that complicate manufacturing processes. These viscosity limitations affect approximately 12-15% of solid oral dosage forms under development in Europe, particularly those containing poorly soluble active ingredients requiring higher excipient loads for bioavailability enhancement.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Other Challenges</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Batch-to-Batch Variability</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Maintaining consistent polymer properties across production batches remains challenging due to natural variations in cellulose sources. Even slight deviations in molecular weight distribution can impact drug release profiles, requiring additional quality control measures that increase operational costs.</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Moisture Sensitivity</strong></p><p>
</p><p>HPMC's hygroscopic nature demands strict environmental controls during manufacturing and storage. Several recalls of HPMC-containing medications in European markets have been attributed to moisture-related stability issues, underscoring the need for improved packaging solutions and handling protocols.</p><p>
