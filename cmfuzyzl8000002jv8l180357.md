# Rice Husk Ash Silica Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Rice Husk Ash Silica (RHAS) is a sustainable and cost-effective alternative to conventional silica, derived from the combustion of rice husks. Rich in high-purity silica, RHAS is produced through controlled burning, often following acid treatment to remove impurities. The material is extensively utilized in industries such as tires, industrial rubber, paints and coatings, animal feed, and personal care, owing to its eco-friendly properties and superior dispersibility.</p><p>
