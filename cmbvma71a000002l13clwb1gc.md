# Sodium Bisulfate Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Sodium Bisulfate (NaHSO4) is a white to yellowish crystalline powder primarily used in various industrial applications. It is an inorganic compound formed by the neutralization of sulfuric acid with sodium chloride or sodium hydroxide. This acid salt is commonly known for its acidic properties and serves as a key component in water treatment, food processing, cleaning compounds, and metal finishing industries. Sodium Bisulfate is often found in technical-grade or food-grade forms depending on the intended application.</p><p>
</p><p>It is primarily used as an acidulant in products like detergents and cleaning agents, and in water treatment processes where it helps regulate pH levels. In the food industry, food-grade sodium bisulfate is used as a preservative and acidulant, while in metal finishing, it is employed to clean metals and prepare them for plating.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
