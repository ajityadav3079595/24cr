</p><p>This steady growth is attributed to the increasing demand for high-efficiency fertilizers, the rising focus on sustainable agricultural practices, and expanding applications in industrial and food sectors.</p><p>
<strong>Definition</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Sulphate of Potash (SOP) is a high-quality potassium fertilizer that contains both potassium and sulfur in a water-soluble form. It is widely used in agriculture to improve crop yields and enhance the quality of fruits, vegetables, and other crops. SOP is preferred over Muriate of Potash (MOP) for crops sensitive to chloride, making it an essential input in high-value crop production. Additionally, SOP finds applications in the food and beverage industry to enhance the taste, appearance, and preservation of certain products.</p><p>
