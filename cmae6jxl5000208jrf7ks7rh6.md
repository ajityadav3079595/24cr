The rising demand for bio-based epoxy curing agents and thermosetting resins further supports market expansion. Historically, the cardanol market has shown steady growth with consistent adoption in niche applications, and this trend is expected to accelerate with ongoing innovations in bio-based material technologies.</p><p>
</p><p>Cardanol is a naturally derived monohydroxy phenol obtained from cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL), a byproduct of the cashew processing industry. With its unique chemical structure featuring a phenolic group and a long aliphatic side chain, cardanol exhibits exceptional flexibility, chemical reactivity, and thermal stability. These properties make it a sustainable and eco-friendly substitute for petroleum-based phenols in a wide range of industrial applications.</p><p>
</p><p>Cardanol is widely used as a raw material in the production of epoxy resins, phenolic resins, and various types of curing agents. It is particularly valuable in the coatings, adhesives, and polymer industries due to its compatibility with other resins and its ability to impart superior flexibility, water resistance, and adhesion. Furthermore, cardanol is gaining traction in the green chemistry landscape due to its renewable origin and lower environmental footprint.</p><p>
