</p><p>This growth is driven by increasing industrialization, rising adoption of advanced catalysts in chemical processes, and expanding applications of aldehydes.</p><p>
</p><p>Hydroformylation Catalysts are key chemical agents used to facilitate the hydroformylation reaction, also known as the oxo process. This catalytic reaction involves the addition of a formyl group (CHO) and a hydrogen atom to a carbon-carbon double bond, converting alkenes into aldehydes. Typically, hydroformylation reactions employ transition metal complexes, such as cobalt or rhodium-based catalysts, in the presence of synthesis gas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide). These aldehydes produced are valuable intermediates in the synthesis of alcohols, acids, and other industrial chemicals, especially within the plasticizers, lubricants, and surfactants industries. The efficiency and selectivity of the catalyst significantly influence the yield and purity of the final product, making catalyst development a critical aspect of modern chemical manufacturing.</p><p>
