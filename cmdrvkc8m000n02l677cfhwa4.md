</p><p>Oxysterols receptor LXR Beta, also known as liver X receptor beta (LXR?), is a nuclear receptor that plays a crucial role in regulating the metabolism of cholesterol and other lipids in the body. LXR? is activated by oxysterols, which are oxidized derivatives of cholesterol, and in response, it regulates the expression of genes involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism, including those involved in cholesterol transport, synthesis, and excretion. LXR? is expressed in various tissues throughout the body, including the liver, intestine, adipose tissue, and immune cells. The activation of LXR? has been shown to have beneficial effects on lipid metabolism and inflammation, making it a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and other metabolic disorders.</p><p>
