<strong>Market Size</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Hydro-Processing Catalysts (HPC) are essential components in the oil refining industry, primarily used in hydrocracking and hydrotreating processes. These catalysts facilitate the removal of impurities like sulfur, nitrogen, and heavy metals from crude oil, enhancing the quality of refined fuels. Hydrocracking breaks down larger hydrocarbon molecules into smaller, more valuable products, whereas hydrotreating removes contaminants to meet environmental and regulatory standards.</p><p>
