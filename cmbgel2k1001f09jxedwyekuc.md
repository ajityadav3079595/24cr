</p><p><strong>Dry offset, also called Letterset, or Indirect Relief Printing, is an offset printing process that combines the characteristics of letterpress and offset. A special plate prints directly onto the blanket of an offset press, and the blanket then offsets the image onto the paper. The process is called dry offset because the plate is not dampened as it would be in the offset lithography process. This technology usually uses a special plate and ink system to ensure that no water is used during the printing process</strong>.</p><p>
