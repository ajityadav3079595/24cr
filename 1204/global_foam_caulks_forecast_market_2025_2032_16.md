</p><p>Foam caulks, also referred to as insulating foam sealants, are polyurethane-based products used to seal gaps and cracks for the purpose of insulation and air barrier creation. These products expand upon application, forming a durable and airtight seal that prevents air leakage, moisture infiltration, and enhances energy efficiency. Foam caulks are frequently used around window and door frames, attic spaces, electrical outlets, and plumbing penetrations. In addition to thermal insulation, they help in reducing airborne sound, increasing indoor comfort, and improving building energy performance.</p><p>
</p><p>The versatility and ease of application make foam caulks a preferred choice across residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. They are also instrumental in meeting stringent energy codes and green building certifications by minimizing thermal bridging and air drafts.</p><p>
