</p><p><strong>Report Overview</strong></p><p>
</p><p></p><p>
</p><p>CH3F is a specialty gas used in the manufacturing process of semiconductor chips for micromachining nitride film by etching. CH3F is mainly used in the manufacture of semiconductor memory chips including NAND flash and DRAM that requires micromachining technology. Since its etching selectivity is higher than those of other gases, CH3F is suitable for micromachining of multi-layer structure of 3D NAND flash. The demand for CH3F has been increasing these days due to start-up of many lines to manufacture 3D NAND flash.</p><p>
