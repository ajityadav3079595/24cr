</p><p>Aluminium Titanic Boron (Al-Ti-B) Alloy is a grain refiner used to enhance aluminum's mechanical properties by introducing titanium and boron additives. The alloy forms TiB2 and TiAl3 particles that act as nucleation sites during solidification, significantly refining grain structure. This process improves tensile strength (by 15-20%), ductility, and corrosion resistance in final aluminum products.</p><p>
</p><p>The market is expanding due to rising adoption in electric vehicle production, where weight reduction directly impacts battery efficiency. Recent advancements include rare earth doping (cerium/lanthanum) to extend grain refinement effectiveness. However, supply chain vulnerabilities for titanium (12% price volatility in 2023) pose challenges. Key players like AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group and KBM Affilips are investing in production optimization to meet the 23% year-on-year demand increase from North American aerospace manufacturers.</p><p>
