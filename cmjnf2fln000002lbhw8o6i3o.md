# Hydrodemetallization (HDM) Catalyst Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Hydrodemetallization (HDM) Catalyst is a crucial component in the oil refining industry, specifically designed to remove metal contaminants such as nickel, vanadium, and iron from crude oil. These metals, if left unremoved, can lead to equipment corrosion, catalyst poisoning, and lower efficiency in refining operations. HDM catalysts facilitate the reaction between hydrogen and metal impurities, converting them into less harmful compounds that can be efficiently separated from the oil stream. This process enhances the quality of refined petroleum products while prolonging the lifespan of refinery equipment.</p><p>
