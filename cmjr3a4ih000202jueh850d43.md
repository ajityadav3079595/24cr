</p><p>Additionally, the lack of standardized testing protocols for micronutrient efficacy makes product comparison difficult. While some states have adopted the Mehlich-3 extraction method for soil testing, others use different analytical techniques, creating confusion about actual nutrient availability and recommended application rates.</p><p>
<strong>MARKET OPPORTUNITIES</strong></p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Expansion of High-Value Specialty Crops to Create New Growth Frontiers</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The rapid growth of specialty crop production (nuts, fruits, vegetables) presents lucrative opportunities for micronutrient suppliers. These crops have 3-5 times higher micronutrient requirements than field crops, with growers demonstrating greater willingness to invest in premium nutrition products. The California almond industry alone is projected to consume over 12,000 MT of zinc and boron annually by 2025 to maintain orchard productivity.
