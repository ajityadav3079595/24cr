</p><p>Historically, the market has exhibited stable growth due to the increasing replacement of PVC films with PU films, especially in industries aiming for eco-friendly and recyclable materials. From 2019 to 2023, the market witnessed a CAGR of around 4.2%, attributed to innovations in film extrusion technologies and enhanced product capabilities.</p><p>
</p><p>Polyurethane (PU) films are high-performance thermoplastic materials known for their flexibility, durability, and resistance to abrasion and chemicals. These films are made from polyester or polyether-based polyurethane and are available in a variety of grades and thicknesses to meet diverse application needs. PU films serve as a versatile material in medical, automotive, textile, and consumer goods industries. Their ability to be laminated, heat-sealed, and combined with other substrates makes them ideal for applications demanding elasticity, waterproofing, and breathability.</p><p>
</p><p>In terms of functionality, PU films are used in applications where breathability and moisture transmission are crucial—such as in wound care dressings or performance apparel. Their biocompatibility and non-toxic nature also render them suitable for healthcare and biomedical applications.</p><p>
