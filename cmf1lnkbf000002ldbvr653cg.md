# Primary Rhenium Metal Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Rhenium is an extremely rare, high-performance transition metal with unique properties that make it indispensable in specialized industries. With an atomic number of 75, it has one of the highest melting points (3,186°C) and exceptional heat resistance. Due to its rarity, rhenium is primarily obtained as a byproduct of molybdenum and copper mining. It is widely used in <strong style="font-size:14px">aerospace</strong> for high-temperature turbine blades, in <strong style="font-size:14px">catalysts</strong> for refining high-octane gasoline, and in <strong style="font-size:14px">electronics</strong> due to its resistance to wear and corrosion.</p><p>
