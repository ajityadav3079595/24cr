# Potassium Permanganate Solution Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Potassium permanganate (KMnO4) is a strong oxidizing agent widely used across various industries. It appears as black-purple crystals with a blue metallic luster and is odorless. Discovered by Johann Glauber in 1659, potassium permanganate is known for its solubility in water and lye, with limited solubility in methanol, acetone, and sulfuric acid. The compound is used extensively in water treatment, disinfection, chemical production, and medical applications for fungal treatment and wound cleaning.</p><p>
