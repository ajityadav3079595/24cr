</p><p>The steady market growth is driven by increasing demand for sustainable and renewable materials in industries such as construction, automotive, and packaging. The market has witnessed a shift towards bio-based polyols as companies seek alternatives to petroleum-based products, further fueling the expansion of the industry.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Definition</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Castor Oil Modified Polyol is a specialized polyol derived from castor oil, a natural and renewable resource extracted from the seeds of the Ricinus communis plant. This type of polyol is commonly used in polyurethane production, adhesives, coatings, and sealants. The unique chemical structure of castor oil enables it to provide superior performance characteristics, including enhanced flexibility, durability, and eco-friendliness. As industries shift towards sustainable and bio-based materials, castor oil modified polyols are gaining prominence due to their low environmental impact and excellent functional properties.</p><p>
