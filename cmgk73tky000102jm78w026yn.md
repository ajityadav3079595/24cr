</p><p>Coco-Caprylate, known chemically as the ester of coconut alcohol and caprylic acid, is a clear, colorless to slightly yellowish emollient oil widely used in the personal care and cosmetics industry. Registered under CAS No. 107525-85-9, it is primarily known for its skin-conditioning properties, high spreadability, and its lightweight, non-greasy feel. Functionally, Coco-Caprylate serves as a natural alternative to synthetic and volatile silicones like Cyclomethicone, offering a sustainable and skin-friendly formulation option in cosmetic products. Due to its excellent emollient and solvent properties, it is used in a variety of personal care formulations such as lotions, sunscreens, hair conditioners, and make-up products.</p><p>
