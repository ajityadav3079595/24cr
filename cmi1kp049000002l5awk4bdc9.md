</p><p><strong>Non-halogen Flame Retardant ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) is a specialized thermoplastic resin formulated to resist combustion without relying on halogenated flame retardants. ABS itself is known for its impact resistance, toughness, and versatility. However, traditional flame-retardant variants often use halogen-based additives, which can emit toxic fumes and pose environmental concerns. In contrast, non-halogen flame retardant ABS achieves flame retardancy using environmentally friendly additives such as phosphorus-based or inorganic compounds. Once removed from a flame source, components made from this material self-extinguish, making it ideal for electronic housings, automotive parts, and construction applications where both safety and sustainability are critical.</strong></p><p>
