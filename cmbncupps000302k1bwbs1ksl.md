# Hydroprocessing Catalysts (HPC) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032

<p>Hydrogenation catalyst is a type of catalyst that facilitates a chemical reaction between molecular hydrogen (H2) and another compound or element, typically in the presence of catalysts like nickel, palladium, or platinum. Hydrogenation is commonly used to reduce or saturate organic compounds, involving the addition of hydrogen atoms to molecules, especially alkenes. Catalysts are essential for enabling the reaction to proceed at usable conditions.</p><p>
