</p><p>China currently leads the global market, accounting for about 30% of the total share, followed by Europe at 23% and North America at 19%. The dominant position of China can be attributed to its large-scale automotive manufacturing industry and increasing investments in automotive R&amp;D.</p><p>
</p><p>The historical trend shows moderate but consistent growth, aligning with trends in automotive production and consumer preference for high-quality, long-lasting vehicle interiors. Additionally, the transition toward lightweight and ergonomic vehicle designs further supports the adoption of advanced PU release agents.</p><p>
</p><p>Automotive Seat PU (Polyurethane) Release Agents are specialized chemical formulations used in the manufacturing process of automotive seats. These agents are applied to molds during the polyurethane foam molding process to facilitate the easy release of finished foam components. The use of PU release agents prevents damage to the molds and ensures that the surface of the molded seat is smooth, defect-free, and of high quality.</p><p>
</p><p>These agents can be either solvent-based or water-based, depending on environmental and performance requirements. Their primary function is to provide a barrier between the mold surface and the molded part, allowing for multiple demoldings without compromising the integrity of either the mold or the product. Besides their application in seat cushioning, these agents are also used in headrests, armrests, and other automotive interior components made from polyurethane foam.</p><p>
