</p><p>The toughening process requires specialized furnaces operating at temperatures exceeding 600°C followed by rapid cooling, making it significantly more energy-intensive than regular glass production. This results in production costs that are 25-40% higher than conventional glass. Small-scale fabricators often struggle with the capital expenditure required for toughening plants, which typically exceed â¹25 crore for basic setups. These high-cost barriers prevent wider adoption, particularly in price-sensitive rural markets and lower-budget construction projects. While the benefits justify the cost in high-value applications, the price differential remains a significant hurdle for mass-market penetration.</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Logistical Challenges and Vulnerability During Transportation</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Toughened glass presents unique logistical difficulties due to its weight and fragility. Despite being stronger than regular glass, it remains susceptible to damage from improper handling and transportation. The requirement for specialized packaging and careful loading increases shipping costs by 15-30%. These challenges are particularly acute in India where road conditions vary greatly between urban and rural areas. Furthermore, once toughened, the glass cannot be cut or modified, requiring precise pre-processing and increasing the risk of incorrect sizing. These factors contribute to higher rejection rates and wastage, adding approximately 8-12% to overall project costs when using toughened glass.</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>Technical Limitations in Certain Applications</strong></p><p>
</p><p>While toughened glass excels in many applications, it has inherent limitations that restrict its use in specific scenarios.
