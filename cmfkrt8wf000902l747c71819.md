The global key manufacturers of Plastic Extrusion Services include Engineered Profiles, New England Tubing Technologies, Zeus, Boyd, Pexco, Altaflo, New Process Fibre Company, M and P Manufacturing and Control Plastics, etc. in 2023, the global top five players have a share approximately % in terms of revenue.</p><p>
Plastic extrusion service suppliers specialize in extruding plastics and polymer compounds into custom and standard profiles and shapes. These services are generally high volume, handling and processing many types of raw plastic material.</p><p>
Extrusion is a process used to create a shape of a fixed cross-sectional profile. Extrusion is done by squeezing material in a closed cavity through a tool known as a die using either a mechanical or hydraulic press. Extrusion produces compressive and shear forces in the stock. No tensile is produced which makes high deformation possible without tearing. The cavity in which the raw material is contained is lined with a wear resistant material. This can withstand the high radial loads that are created when the material is pushed through the die.</p><p>
Extrusion is a near-net-shape process, meaning it eliminates scrap and waste metal generated from machine processes which cut material from a larger block. Less waste means lower material costs and no time or money used for machining and disposal of the waste metal.</p><p>
In addition, very complex sections can be produced by extrusion, which are not achievable with other shaping techniques. Extrusion can also offer economic advantages in that the dies are relatively inexpensive and are interchangeable, so that one extrusion machine can be used for the production of a wide variety of sections.</p><p>
