</p><p>Sodium sulfocyanate, also known as sodium thiocyanate, is a chemical compound with the formula NaSCN. It is a colorless, deliquescent salt that is commonly used in chemical synthesis, particularly as a precursor for pharmaceuticals and other specialty chemicals. Sodium thiocyanate is also used in the laboratory as a test for the presence of Fe3+ ions. In the healthcare sector, it can be used as an anticoagulant to prevent blood clotting and lower blood pressure. It is important to handle sodium thiocyanate with caution as it can produce toxic fumes when heated.</p><p>
